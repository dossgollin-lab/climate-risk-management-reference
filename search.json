    "text": "Motivation and Scope\n\nHistory\nThis project emerged from two courses taught at Rice University by James Doss-Gollin: CEVE 543 focused on climate hazard and extremes and CEVE 421/521 focused on risk management.\n\n\nAim\nThe book is motivated by questions like\n\nWhat is the probability distribution of wind speeds that a building structure might experience?\nWhat will the probability distribution of extreme rainfall be in 2050, and what drives uncertainty in this estimate?\nWhat is the probability distribution of tropical cyclone losses across a regional portfolio?\nWhen, and how high, should a house be elevated to proactively manage future flood risk?\nWhat are robust, efficient, and equitable strategies for reducing flood risk in an urban area?\n\nThese questions span scales and sectors, yet they share fundamental challenges: characterizing extreme events, quantifying uncertainty, assessing risks, and making robust decisions when probability distributions are unknown or contested. Moreover, there is not a single correct answer to these questions, or a single method that will incontrovertibly answer them.",

    "text": "How to Use This Resource\nThe book is designed to be useful for practitioners, students, and teachers. Teachers may use individual chapters in their courses. Students may use it as a class text or reference. Practitioners may focus on specific chapters relevant to their work. Each chapter includes learning objectives and can be read independently, though some chapters build on concepts introduced in others.\n\nStructure\n\nThe Preface introduces the book’s motivation and frames key challenges\nPart 1 introduces key topics in probability, inference, Bayesian methods, optimization, machine learning, and Earth science. Rather than providing a comprehensive treatment, this part focuses on essential concepts and links to further resources.\nPart 2 focuses on hazard assessment, namely modeling climate hazards and extremes. Material is organized around thematic applications and predictive tasks. The foundational idea is integrating information from noisy and/or biased sources to estimate the joint probability distribution of relevant hydroclimatic variables.\nPart 3 risk management, which involves both mapping hazard to risk and designing interventions to manage these risks. Key ideas include the sequential nature of decisions, the pursuit of unclear and/or contested objectives, and the need to account for the sensitivity of estimated probability distributions (of hazard and of other relevant physical, social, and economic variables) to underlying models and assumptions.\nComputational notebooks written in Julia illustrate and complement the methods and concepts discussed in the text. While notebooks are referenced in the text, they are designed as standalone and self-contained resources.\n\n\n\nPrerequisites\nBasic probability and multivariate calculus, along with linear algebra, are sufficient mathematical foundations for this textbook. Some exposure to Earth science, hydrology, water resources, or related topics is strongly encouraged for context, though not strictly necessary for understanding methods. This book builds on a wide range of topics and methods in statistics, machine learning, optimization, and Earth science, and expertise in any of these areas may deepen your understanding, but is not necessary. No programming is required to read the book, but going through computational examples and applying methods to your own problems, which can substantially strengthen your understanding, does require programming.",

    "text": "What is climate risk?\nClimate risks arise at the intersection of climate hazards, exposed systems, and vulnerability. They manifest when extreme or changing climate conditions—floods, droughts, extreme temperatures, sea-level rise, or shifting precipitation patterns—impact human and natural systems that are exposed and vulnerable to these conditions. The financial sector terms these “physical risks” to distinguish them from transition risks related to policy and market changes.\nClimate risks span scales from the hyperlocal (a single building’s flood exposure) to the global (climate impacts on agricultural productivity). They encompass immediate acute risks from individual extreme events and longer-term chronic risks from gradual climate changes. Crucially, climate risks are not solely natural phenomena but emerge from the complex interactions between climate hazards and the human systems—infrastructure, institutions, communities, and economies—that experience their impacts.\nClimate risk is often defined as the product of hazard (probability that something will happen) and consequences (exposure and vulnerability). However, it’s often helpful to start with the decisions we care about.",

    "text": "Risk management\nThe goal of assessing climate risks is to manage them, as is the focus of Part III. We manage climate risks by\n\nbuilding infrastructure, such as seawalls, stormwater pipes, oyster beds, green roofs, dams\ndesigning policy, such as water pricing, land-use regulations, building codes\nresponding to climate disasters through disaster response and recovery. While emergency management is beyond the scope of the book, disaster prevention (through infrastructure, policy, etc) and preparation (planning evacuation routes, assessing resource needs, etc) are problems that the tools of this class can inform.\n\nA key insight from considering these applications is that climate risks are not natural phenomena, but occur at the intersection of natural and human systems. A second insight is that decisions about how to manage climate risks do not depend only on climate hazard, but also on human systems and values.\n\n\nExposure and vulnerability\nHazards do not create consequences by themselves. Hazards affect things that we care about, whether natural ecosystems, human homes, infrastructure systems, or something else. Quantitatively these are often described as exposure and vulnerability. However, this is not always a helpful framing because everything is exposed, to at least some degree, to climate hazards.\n\n\nClimate hazard\nClimate hazards have several key characteristics:\n\nLocation-specific impacts: Specific weather patterns cause different things in different places—tropical cyclones cause extreme winds on the Gulf Coast, while persistent intense rainfall causes flooding in major rivers\nRequire Earth science and data: Understanding hazards requires both physical process knowledge and empirical data\nVariable focus on extremes: Some applications care about extremes, but others (e.g., water management) care about shifts in the whole distribution\nMulti-scale variability: Characterized by variability across multiple spatial and temporal scales",

    "section": "What are good strategies?",
    "text": "What are good strategies?\n\nThe simple story\nIn principle, managing climate risks should be straightforward. If we had clear objectives and well-characterized uncertainty, there are established mathematical formalisms for decision-making under uncertainty. Notably, Bayesian Decision Theory provides an elegant framework: find the action \\(a\\) that maximizes expected utility \\[\n\\mathbb{E}[U(a)] = \\int U(a, s) p(s) ds,\n\\] where \\(U(a, s)\\) is the utility of action \\(a\\) given state of the world \\(s\\), and \\(p(s)\\) is the joint probability distribution over states of the world. The expectation \\(\\mathbb{E}[U(a)]\\) represents the average utility we would expect from action \\(a\\) across all possible future states, weighted by their probabilities (see Chapter on Probability and Statistics for mathematical foundations).\nWith this framework and modern advances in operations research and optimization, we could frame climate risk management as a large-scale optimization problem. This might still be a challenging problem, requiring sophisticated optimization methods, large-ensemble Monte Carlo simulation, high-performance computing, and more, but fundamentally there would be a right answer that we could identify, at least seek to approximate.\n\n\nWhy this isn’t enough\nIn practice, climate risk management defies this idealized approach for several fundamental reasons:\n\nDeep uncertainty: Unlike textbook optimization problems, we rarely have well-defined probability distributions over future states. Climate risks involve poorly characterized, multiple, and interacting uncertainties spanning physical processes (climate projections), socioeconomic factors (development patterns, institutional capacity, human behavior), and their complex dependencies. The probability distributions we need span climate hazards, exposure patterns, vulnerability functions, and policy effectiveness—all evolving in ways that resist precise characterization.\nLarge and poorly defined decision spaces: The solution space includes not just individual projects but entire systems: infrastructure networks, policy portfolios, risk transfer arrangements, and adaptive management sequences. These decisions interact across scales, sectors, and time horizons in ways that resist comprehensive optimization.\nContested objectives: Different stakeholders hold different values about what we should optimize for—economic efficiency, equity, robustness, or flexibility. These objectives often conflict, and their relative importance is itself contested and evolving.\n\nThis brings us to a crucial insight: we cannot simply frame climate risk management as a big optimization problem. The field has witnessed an explosion of computational tools—climate models with ever-finer resolution, machine learning algorithms for processing vast datasets, and sophisticated visualization platforms for rendering complex projections. While these advances represent genuine progress, their proliferation has created new challenges for practitioners seeking to manage real-world climate risks.\nThe abundance of available tools does not automatically translate to better decisions. Indeed, the sophistication of modern computational approaches can obscure fundamental questions about problem framing, uncertainty characterization, and appropriate methods selection. Without solid conceptual foundations, practitioners may find themselves applying powerful tools inappropriately or mistaking methodological novelty for substantive insight.\n\n\nThe stakes of getting it wrong\nThe consequences of inadequate climate risk management are severe and diverse. Infrastructure failures occur when designs based on historical extremes prove insufficient for future conditions—leading to flooded neighborhoods when storm drains are undersized, or to costly over-design when extreme projections are treated as certainties. Policy mistakes compound these problems: development policies that ignore flood risks concentrate vulnerable populations in harm’s way, while overly conservative regulations can stifle economic development without commensurate risk reduction benefits.\nFinancial miscalculations affect both public and private sectors. Insurance companies that underestimate climate risks face catastrophic losses, while those that overestimate risks price themselves out of markets. Infrastructure investors struggle to balance climate resilience against cost constraints, often erring toward solutions that prove either inadequate or prohibitively expensive. These failures cascade across scales: a poorly designed local drainage system contributes to regional flood management challenges, while flawed national climate risk assessments misguide infrastructure investment priorities across entire countries.",

Floods reflect not just local rainfall but also broader weather systems and seasonal cycles.\nUnderstanding these connections is crucial for risk assessment because climate science helps us answer three fundamental questions:\n\nWhat physical processes create hazardous weather patterns? Understanding the mechanisms behind hurricanes, droughts, heat waves, and floods helps us identify when and where they’re most likely to occur.\nHow do these patterns vary naturally over time? Climate systems exhibit variability on multiple timescales—from seasonal cycles to multi-decadal oscillations—that affect the frequency and intensity of extreme events.\nHow might climate change alter these patterns?

    "text": "8.1 Motivation\nThe design of reliable infrastructure, such as stormwater systems in Harris County, Texas, depends on a quantitative understanding of extreme environmental events. Engineers must characterize the magnitude and frequency of rare phenomena. For example, they might need to determine the expected recurrence interval of a daily rainfall total that exceeds a critical design threshold, such as 300 mm.\nAn initial, intuitive approach is to analyze the historical record.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnalysis of over 70 years of daily precipitation data from a station in Houston reveals 13 days where rainfall exceeded 150 mm. This allows for a simple empirical estimate of the event’s frequency. Thirteen exceedances in 71 years suggests an average recurrence interval of approximately 5.5 years. For the 300 mm threshold, however, the historical record contains zero events. An empirical estimate of the probability is therefore zero, which is uninformative for risk assessment and infrastructure design. We require a method for extrapolating beyond the range of observed data.\nA natural extension would be to fit a standard parametric probability distribution—such as a Gamma distribution, which is commonly used for precipitation—to the entire set of daily rainfall observations. One could then use the extreme upper tail of the fitted distribution to estimate the probability of exceeding 300 mm.\nThis approach, however, is fundamentally unreliable. The goodness-of-fit of a parametric model is driven by its ability to describe the bulk of the data, where observations are plentiful. Minor model misspecifications in this high-density region can translate into substantial errors in the far tails of the distribution, where data are sparse or nonexistent. As stated by Coles (2001), the foundational text on this topic, “very small discrepancies in the estimate of \\(F\\) can lead to substantial discrepancies for \\(F^n\\)”, where in our example \\(F\\) is the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of daily rainfall while \\(F^n\\) is the CDF of the maximum daily rainfall over \\(n\\) days.\nThe models that best describe the central tendency of a process are not necessarily suitable for describing its extremes. This fragility of tail extrapolation necessitates a theoretical framework developed specifically for modeling the behavior of extreme values.\nA naive empirical estimator for the exceedance probability of a value \\(x\\) based on \\(n\\) observations \\(X_i\\) is the simple proportion of exceedances:\n\\[\n\\hat{P}(X &gt; x) = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\mathbf{1}(X_i &gt; x)\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\mathbf{1}(\\cdot)\\) is the indicator function. This is useful when the number of exceedances is large, but fails for extrapolation when the sum is zero, as was the case for the 300mm threshold. This mathematically demonstrates the limitations of simple empirical methods and motivates the specialized approaches that follow.",

    "section": "8.2 Approaches for modeling extreme values",
    "text": "8.2 Approaches for modeling extreme values\nExtreme Value Theory (EVT) provides such a framework. Rather than modeling the entire distribution of a process, EVT focuses on the distribution of its extreme values. There are two primary methods for extracting these values from a time series.\n\n8.2.1 Block maxima\nIn this method, the period of observation is divided into non-overlapping blocks of equal duration (e.g., years). For each block of size \\(n\\), we define the block maximum as \\(M_n = \\max\\{X_1, \\dots, X_n\\}\\). This yields a new time series of block maxima. A crucial conceptual point is that we are not studying a single maximum possible value of the process. Instead, we are studying the distribution of the sample maximum, \\(M_n\\), which is itself a random variable. This is why a distribution like the GEV is needed to describe its behavior. This approach is intuitive and directly relates to concepts of annual risk, but it can be inefficient as it discards other potentially extreme events within a block.\n\n\n8.2.2 Peaks-over-threshold\nThe peaks-over-threshold (POT) method defines a set of exceedances over a high threshold \\(u\\) as \\(\\{X_i : X_i &gt; u\\}\\). The variable of interest is the value of the excesses themselves, \\(Y = X_i - u\\), for all \\(X_i\\) in the set of exceedances. The GPD is a model for these excess amounts, not the raw values. This approach is more data-efficient than the block maxima method. Its primary challenge lies in selecting an appropriate threshold, which involves a trade-off between bias (if the threshold is too low) and variance (if the threshold is too high, yielding too few data points). In practice, exceedances may occur in clusters (e.g., during a multi-day storm event). Therefore, a declustering algorithm is often applied to the raw exceedances to ensure that the events being modeled are approximately independent.",

    "section": "8.3 Asymptotic theory for extremes",
    "text": "8.3 Asymptotic theory for extremes\nThe statistical justification for both the block maxima and POT approaches comes from asymptotic theorems that describe the limiting distributions of extreme values.\n\n8.3.1 Theory for block maxima: The GEV distribution\nThe theoretical justification for the block maxima approach is the Extremal Types Theorem. This theorem states that for a large class of underlying distributions, if a stable, non-degenerate limiting distribution for the block maximum \\(M_n\\) exists, it must be the Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) distribution.\nA critical point is that the theorem applies to a linearly rescaled or normalized maximum. Consider the raw maximum, \\(M_n\\). As the block size \\(n\\) increases, the expected value of \\(M_n\\) will also increase (or stay the same)—its distribution drifts towards larger values and does not converge. A similar issue arises in the Central Limit Theorem (CLT), which describes the convergence of a sample mean. The CLT does not apply to the raw sum of random variables, but to a normalized version of it.\nThe Extremal Types Theorem is the direct analog of the CLT for maxima. It states that there exist sequences of normalizing constants, a location parameter \\(b_n\\) and a scale parameter \\(a_n &gt; 0\\), such that the distribution of the normalized maximum, \\((M_n - b_n)/a_n\\), converges to the GEV distribution as \\(n \\to \\infty\\).\nIn practice, we do not need to know the specific functional forms of \\(a_n\\) and \\(b_n\\). Instead, for a fixed, large block size \\(n\\) (e.g., one year of daily data), we fit the GEV distribution directly to the series of block maxima. The GEV’s location and scale parameters, \\(\\mu\\) and \\(\\sigma\\), effectively absorb and account for the normalization that the theory requires. The GEV is a flexible three-parameter family with a cumulative distribution function (CDF) given by:\n\\[\nG(z) = \\exp\\left\\{ -\\left[ 1 + \\xi \\left( \\frac{z - \\mu}{\\sigma} \\right) \\right]^{-1/\\xi} \\right\\}\n\\]\nThis is defined on the set \\(\\{z: 1 + \\xi(z - \\mu)/\\sigma &gt; 0\\}\\). The parameters are location (\\(\\mu\\)), scale (\\(\\sigma &gt; 0\\)), and shape (\\(\\xi\\)). These parameters implicitly depend on the block size \\(n\\).\n\n\n8.3.2 Theory for threshold exceedances: The GPD\nThe corresponding theory for the POT approach is the Pickands–Balkema–de Haan Theorem. It states that for a wide range of distributions, the distribution of excesses over a high threshold \\(u\\) can be approximated by the Generalized Pareto Distribution (GPD). Conceptually, if the GEV describes the behavior of the maximum of a large block, the GPD describes the behavior of the distribution’s tail that produced that maximum. It is the distribution one would expect to see by “zooming in” on the tail of a distribution above a high threshold.\nThe GPD is a two-parameter family with a CDF for excesses \\(Y = X - u\\) given by:\n\\[\nH(y) = 1 - \\left( 1 + \\frac{\\xi y}{\\sigma_u} \\right)^{-1/\\xi}\n\\]\nThis is defined on \\(\\{y: y &gt; 0 \\text{ and } (1 + \\xi y / \\sigma_u) &gt; 0\\}\\). The parameters are the shape, \\(\\xi\\), and a scale parameter \\(\\sigma_u\\) that depends on the threshold \\(u\\). If the parent distribution’s maxima are GEV-distributed with parameters \\((\\mu, \\sigma, \\xi)\\), then the GPD scale parameter is given by \\(\\sigma_u = \\sigma + \\xi(u - \\mu)\\). This key result shows that the GPD scale parameter is a linear function of the threshold \\(u\\), a property that is used in advanced diagnostics for threshold selection.\n\n\n8.3.3 The shape parameter (\\(\\xi\\)): A unifying concept\nThe shape parameter, \\(\\xi\\), is the most critical parameter in extreme value analysis and has the same interpretation in both the GEV and GPD. It governs the tail behavior of the distribution.\n\n\\(\\xi = 0\\) (Gumbel-type tail): The tail decays exponentially (light tail).\n\\(\\xi &gt; 0\\) (Fréchet-type tail): The tail decays as a polynomial (heavy tail), with no upper bound.\n\\(\\xi &lt; 0\\) (Weibull-type tail): The distribution has a finite upper bound.\n\n\n\n8.3.4 Connection between GEV and GPD\nThe GEV and GPD models are intrinsically linked. If the block maxima of a process follow a GEV distribution with parameters \\((\\mu, \\sigma, \\xi)\\), then for a high threshold \\(u\\), the threshold excesses follow a GPD with the same shape parameter \\(\\xi\\). This provides a theoretical consistency between the two primary modeling approaches.",

    "text": "8.4 Return periods and return levels\n\n8.4.1 Definitions and Calculation\nThe output of an extreme value analysis is typically expressed in terms of return periods and return levels. The N-year return level, \\(z_N\\), is the level expected to be exceeded on average once every \\(N\\) years. It corresponds to the quantile of the distribution with an annual exceedance probability of \\(p = 1/N\\).\nFor the GEV distribution, it is calculated by inverting the CDF:\n\\[\nz_N = \\mu - \\frac{\\sigma}{\\xi} \\left[ 1 - (-\\ln(1-p))^{-\\xi} \\right]\n\\]\nCalculating return levels from a GPD model requires an additional step. If \\(\\zeta_u\\) is the rate of threshold exceedances (e.g., the average number of exceedances per year), the \\(N\\)-year return level is the value \\(z_N\\) that is exceeded with probability \\(1/(N \\zeta_u)\\). It is calculated by adding the threshold back to the corresponding quantile of the GPD:\n\\[\nz_N = u + \\frac{\\sigma_u}{\\xi} \\left[ (N \\zeta_u)^\\xi - 1 \\right]\n\\]\n\n\n8.4.2 Return level plots\nA standard diagnostic and visualization tool is the return level plot. This plot graphs the estimated return level \\(z_N\\) against the return period \\(N\\), with \\(N\\) typically plotted on a logarithmic scale. The curvature of the fitted line is a direct visualization of the shape parameter, \\(\\xi\\): a straight line implies \\(\\xi=0\\), a concave curve implies \\(\\xi&gt;0\\), and a convex curve implies \\(\\xi&lt;0\\).\n[Placeholder for a Return Level Plot showing a fitted GEV or GPD curve with confidence intervals.]",

    "text": "8.5 Plotting positions\nTo visually assess model fit, the fitted model is plotted against the observed maxima. For this purpose, we require a method to assign a non-exceedance probability (and thus a return period) to each observed maximum. For a sample of \\(n\\) block maxima, let \\(z_{(1)} &lt; z_{(2)} &lt; \\dots &lt; z_{(n)}\\) be the ordered values. We estimate the probability \\(P(Z \\le z_{(k)})\\) using a plotting position formula. These formulas generally take the form:\n\\[\np_k = \\frac{k - a}{n + 1 - 2a}\n\\]\nwhere \\(k\\) is the rank of the observation and \\(a\\) is a parameter. Common choices include:\n\nWeibull: \\(a=0\\), giving \\(p_k = k/(n+1)\\).\nGringorten: \\(a=0.44\\), giving \\(p_k = (k-0.44)/(n+0.12)\\). This is often recommended as an unbiased choice for Gumbel-type distributions.\n\nThe empirical return period for the \\(k\\)-th observation is then estimated as \\(1/(1-p_k)\\).",

This implies that the statistical properties of extreme events do not change. In the context of climate change, this assumption may be invalid and requires more advanced non-stationary models.\nPractical Choices: The chosen methodology dictates key practical decisions. For the BM approach, the block size must be large enough for the asymptotic theory to hold but small enough to retain a reasonable sample size. For the POT approach, the threshold selection is a critical step that balances bias and variance.",

    "text": "A.2 Dig deeper\n\nA.2.1 Julia\nJulia is a fast, modern programming language designed for scientific computing. Its syntax closely mirrors mathematical notation, making it intuitive for researchers while delivering performance comparable to C and Fortran.\nJuliaUp is the official Julia version manager. It simplifies installation, allows you to maintain multiple Julia versions simultaneously, and keeps your installation current with the latest releases. This is especially useful as the Julia ecosystem evolves rapidly.\nSee the Julia page for more.\n\n\nA.2.2 Quarto\nQuarto is a scientific publishing system that enables you to combine code, results, and narrative text in reproducible documents. Think of it as the next generation of R Markdown, but with multi-language support (Julia, Python, R, and more).\nThis textbook is written in Quarto. Unlike traditional notebooks, Quarto documents are plain text files that render to multiple output formats (HTML, PDF, Word, presentations) while maintaining computational reproducibility.\nYou can learn more at:\n\nOfficial Tutorial: Hello, Quarto - basic document creation\nOfficial Tutorial: Computations - integrating code\nComprehensive Quarto documentation\n\n\nA.2.2.1 Writing with Markdown and math\nQuarto uses Markdown syntax with LaTeX math notation. Essential references:\n\nMarkdown Cheatsheet - basic text formatting\nLaTeX Cheatsheet - mathematical notation\nMathpix Snip - convert equation images to LaTeX code (free tier available)\nDetexify - draw symbols to find LaTeX commands\n\n\n\n\nA.2.3 Visual Studio Code\nVisual Studio Code is a free, open-source code editor developed by Microsoft. Its strength lies in its extensibility—thousands of extensions add language support, debugging capabilities, and productivity tools.\nFor our workflow, the Julia extension transforms VS Code into a full Julia development environment with syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion, integrated debugging, and a built-in REPL. The Quarto extension provides similar capabilities for computational documents, including live preview and cell execution.\nYou can learn more at the official tutorial.\n\n\nA.2.4 Git and GitHub\nGit is a distributed version control system that tracks changes in your code over time. GitHub is a cloud-based platform that hosts Git repositories and adds collaboration features like issue tracking, pull requests, and project management.\nVersion control is essential for reproducible research—it allows you to track changes, collaborate with others, recover from mistakes, and share your work publicly. This textbook itself is maintained on GitHub.\nYou can learn more at:\n\nGit and GitHub for Poets - beginner-friendly video series\nGitHub Hello World – official docs\nVersion Control - comprehensive guide from MIT’s “Missing Semester”",

    "text": "High-Level Syntax: Julia has a clean and expressive syntax that closely parallels mathematical notation.\nPerformance: Julia compiles to efficient machine code, achieving speeds comparable to low-level languages like C and Fortran. This solves the “two-language problem,” where you might prototype in a high-level language but need to rewrite for performance.\nSimplified Dependencies: Eliminates or reduces the need for dependencies on C and Fortran libraries, which simplifies installation and maintenance.\nOpen-Source and Shareable: Julia is completely open-source with excellent package management for reproducible research environments.\nStrong Ecosystem: Despite being newer, Julia has a rapidly growing ecosystem of high-quality libraries for scientific domains.\n\n\n\n\nJulia Data Science textbook is didactic and clear\nWhy We Created Julia from the founders\nWhy Julia Manifesto is more comprehensive",

    "section": "",
    "text": "Coding is an integral part of real-world climate-risk analysis, and large language models (LLMs; often referred to as “AI” models) are rapidly changing how some kinds of coding happen. Beyond web-based chatbots, you may have useed tools like GitHub Copilot (free for students and educators) or Claude Code (see free Deeplearning.AI Course). LLMs use powerful new technologies that can support learning and replace tedious tasks, but they can also threaten your intellectual growth and skill development (Kosmyna et al. 2025; Bastani et al. 2025).\nIt is clear that there are some tasks that should be delegated to these models and some tasks that must remain human-driven. However, there are tremendous differences of opinion about how most tasks in the middle can or should be allocated. As you wrestle with these questions for yourself, you should explore resources like:\n\nAI Snake Oil is a blog that seeks to dispel hype, remove misconceptions, and clarify the limits of AI. The authors are in the Princeton University Department of Computer Science.\nAI software assistants make the hardest kinds of bugs to spot from Pluralistic is a thoughtful and deep blog post about the perils of (mis)using LLMs for coding.\nOne Useful Thing is a newsletter about AI focused on implications for work and education. The authors’ prompt library is also a good resource for working with LLMs.\nEd Zitron’s Where’s Your Ed At is a newsletter that takes a critical perspective on the business models and hype narratives around AI.\n\n\n\n\n\nBastani, Hamsa, Osbert Bastani, Alp Sungu, Haosen Ge, Özge Kabakcı, and Rei Mariman. 2025. “Generative AI Without Guardrails Can Harm Learning: Evidence from High School Mathematics.” Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 122 (26): e2422633122. https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2422633122.\n\n\nKosmyna, Nataliya, Eugene Hauptmann, Ye Tong Yuan, Jessica Situ, Xian-Hao Liao, Ashly Vivian Beresnitzky, Iris Braunstein, and Pattie Maes. 2025. “Your Brain on ChatGPT: Accumulation of Cognitive Debt When Using an AI Assistant for Essay Writing Task.” June 10, 2025. https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2506.08872.",
