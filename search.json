    "text": "Motivation and Scope\n\nHistory\nThis project emerged from two courses taught at Rice University by James Doss-Gollin: CEVE 543 focused on climate hazard and extremes and CEVE 421/521 focused on risk management.\n\n\nAim\nThe book is motivated by questions like\n\nWhat is the probability distribution of wind speeds that a building structure might experience?\nWhat will the probability distribution of extreme rainfall be in 2050, and what drives uncertainty in this estimate?\nWhat is the probability distribution of tropical cyclone losses across a regional portfolio?\nWhen, and how high, should a house be elevated to proactively manage future flood risk?\nWhat are robust, efficient, and equitable strategies for reducing flood risk in an urban area?\n\nThese questions span scales and sectors, yet they share fundamental challenges: characterizing extreme events, quantifying uncertainty, assessing risks, and making robust decisions when probability distributions are unknown or contested. Moreover, there is not a single correct answer to these questions, or a single method that will incontrovertibly answer them.",

    "text": "How to Use This Resource\nThe book is designed to be useful for practitioners, students, and teachers. Teachers may use individual chapters in their courses. Students may use it as a class text or reference. Practitioners may focus on specific chapters relevant to their work. Each chapter includes learning objectives and can be read independently, though some chapters build on concepts introduced in others.\n\nStructure\n\nThe Preface introduces the book’s motivation and frames key challenges\nPart 1 introduces key topics in probability, inference, Bayesian methods, optimization, machine learning, and Earth science. Rather than providing a comprehensive treatment, this part focuses on essential concepts and links to further resources.\nPart 2 focuses on hazard assessment, namely modeling climate hazards and extremes. Material is organized around thematic applications and predictive tasks. The foundational idea is integrating information from noisy and/or biased sources to estimate the joint probability distribution of relevant hydroclimatic variables.\nPart 3 risk management, which involves both mapping hazard to risk and designing interventions to manage these risks. Key ideas include the sequential nature of decisions, the pursuit of unclear and/or contested objectives, and the need to account for the sensitivity of estimated probability distributions (of hazard and of other relevant physical, social, and economic variables) to underlying models and assumptions.\nComputational notebooks written in Julia illustrate and complement the methods and concepts discussed in the text. While notebooks are referenced in the text, they are designed as standalone and self-contained resources.\n\n\n\nPrerequisites\nBasic probability and multivariate calculus, along with linear algebra, are sufficient mathematical foundations for this textbook. Some exposure to Earth science, hydrology, water resources, or related topics is strongly encouraged for context, though not strictly necessary for understanding methods. This book builds on a wide range of topics and methods in statistics, machine learning, optimization, and Earth science, and expertise in any of these areas may deepen your understanding, but is not necessary. No programming is required to read the book, but going through computational examples and applying methods to your own problems, which can substantially strengthen your understanding, does require programming.",

    "text": "What is climate risk?\nClimate risks arise at the intersection of climate hazards, exposed systems, and vulnerability. They manifest when extreme or changing climate conditions—floods, droughts, extreme temperatures, sea-level rise, or shifting precipitation patterns—impact human and natural systems that are exposed and vulnerable to these conditions. The financial sector terms these “physical risks” to distinguish them from transition risks related to policy and market changes.\nClimate risks span scales from the hyperlocal (a single building’s flood exposure) to the global (climate impacts on agricultural productivity). They encompass immediate acute risks from individual extreme events and longer-term chronic risks from gradual climate changes. Crucially, climate risks are not solely natural phenomena but emerge from the complex interactions between climate hazards and the human systems—infrastructure, institutions, communities, and economies—that experience their impacts.\nClimate risk is often defined as the product of hazard (probability that something will happen) and consequences (exposure and vulnerability). However, it’s often helpful to start with the decisions we care about.",

    "text": "Risk management\nThe goal of assessing climate risks is to manage them, as is the focus of Part III. We manage climate risks by\n\nbuilding infrastructure, such as seawalls, stormwater pipes, oyster beds, green roofs, dams\ndesigning policy, such as water pricing, land-use regulations, building codes\nresponding to climate disasters through disaster response and recovery. While emergency management is beyond the scope of the book, disaster prevention (through infrastructure, policy, etc) and preparation (planning evacuation routes, assessing resource needs, etc) are problems that the tools of this class can inform.\n\nA key insight from considering these applications is that climate risks are not natural phenomena, but occur at the intersection of natural and human systems. A second insight is that decisions about how to manage climate risks do not depend only on climate hazard, but also on human systems and values.\n\n\nExposure and vulnerability\nHazards do not create consequences by themselves. Hazards affect things that we care about, whether natural ecosystems, human homes, infrastructure systems, or something else. Quantitatively these are often described as exposure and vulnerability. However, this is not always a helpful framing because everything is exposed, to at least some degree, to climate hazards.\n\n\nClimate hazard\nClimate hazards have several key characteristics:\n\nLocation-specific impacts: Specific weather patterns cause different things in different places—tropical cyclones cause extreme winds on the Gulf Coast, while persistent intense rainfall causes flooding in major rivers\nRequire Earth science and data: Understanding hazards requires both physical process knowledge and empirical data\nVariable focus on extremes: Some applications care about extremes, but others (e.g., water management) care about shifts in the whole distribution\nMulti-scale variability: Characterized by variability across multiple spatial and temporal scales",

    "section": "What are good strategies?",
    "text": "What are good strategies?\n\nThe simple story\nIn principle, managing climate risks should be straightforward. If we had clear objectives and well-characterized uncertainty, there are established mathematical formalisms for decision-making under uncertainty. Notably, Bayesian Decision Theory provides an elegant framework: find the action \\(a\\) that maximizes expected utility \\[\n\\mathbb{E}[U(a)] = \\int U(a, s) p(s) ds,\n\\] where \\(U(a, s)\\) is the utility of action \\(a\\) given state of the world \\(s\\), and \\(p(s)\\) is the joint probability distribution over states of the world. The expectation \\(\\mathbb{E}[U(a)]\\) represents the average utility we would expect from action \\(a\\) across all possible future states, weighted by their probabilities (see Chapter on Probability and Statistics for mathematical foundations).\nWith this framework and modern advances in operations research and optimization, we could frame climate risk management as a large-scale optimization problem. This might still be a challenging problem, requiring sophisticated optimization methods, large-ensemble Monte Carlo simulation, high-performance computing, and more, but fundamentally there would be a right answer that we could identify, at least seek to approximate.\n\n\nWhy this isn’t enough\nIn practice, climate risk management defies this idealized approach for several fundamental reasons:\n\nDeep uncertainty: Unlike textbook optimization problems, we rarely have well-defined probability distributions over future states. Climate risks involve poorly characterized, multiple, and interacting uncertainties spanning physical processes (climate projections), socioeconomic factors (development patterns, institutional capacity, human behavior), and their complex dependencies. The probability distributions we need span climate hazards, exposure patterns, vulnerability functions, and policy effectiveness—all evolving in ways that resist precise characterization.\nLarge and poorly defined decision spaces: The solution space includes not just individual projects but entire systems: infrastructure networks, policy portfolios, risk transfer arrangements, and adaptive management sequences. These decisions interact across scales, sectors, and time horizons in ways that resist comprehensive optimization.\nContested objectives: Different stakeholders hold different values about what we should optimize for—economic efficiency, equity, robustness, or flexibility. These objectives often conflict, and their relative importance is itself contested and evolving.\n\nThis brings us to a crucial insight: we cannot simply frame climate risk management as a big optimization problem. The field has witnessed an explosion of computational tools—climate models with ever-finer resolution, machine learning algorithms for processing vast datasets, and sophisticated visualization platforms for rendering complex projections. While these advances represent genuine progress, their proliferation has created new challenges for practitioners seeking to manage real-world climate risks.\nThe abundance of available tools does not automatically translate to better decisions. Indeed, the sophistication of modern computational approaches can obscure fundamental questions about problem framing, uncertainty characterization, and appropriate methods selection. Without solid conceptual foundations, practitioners may find themselves applying powerful tools inappropriately or mistaking methodological novelty for substantive insight.\n\n\nThe stakes of getting it wrong\nThe consequences of inadequate climate risk management are severe and diverse. Infrastructure failures occur when designs based on historical extremes prove insufficient for future conditions—leading to flooded neighborhoods when storm drains are undersized, or to costly over-design when extreme projections are treated as certainties. Policy mistakes compound these problems: development policies that ignore flood risks concentrate vulnerable populations in harm’s way, while overly conservative regulations can stifle economic development without commensurate risk reduction benefits.\nFinancial miscalculations affect both public and private sectors. Insurance companies that underestimate climate risks face catastrophic losses, while those that overestimate risks price themselves out of markets. Infrastructure investors struggle to balance climate resilience against cost constraints, often erring toward solutions that prove either inadequate or prohibitively expensive. These failures cascade across scales: a poorly designed local drainage system contributes to regional flood management challenges, while flawed national climate risk assessments misguide infrastructure investment priorities across entire countries.",

They are the final expression of a complex, interconnected system of climate drivers that operate on scales from planetary to local. Understanding this multi-scale system is the core task of climate science in risk assessment. It allows us to build a causal chain from the large-scale drivers to the local impacts, helping us answer three fundamental questions:\n\nWhat physical processes create the specific weather patterns like hurricanes or droughts that drive hazards?\nHow do these patterns vary naturally over years and decades?\nHow might the statistics of these patterns be shifting?\n\nThis chapter provides the physical foundation for this understanding.

    "text": "1.2 Global energy budget and radiative forcing\nEarth’s climate system is fundamentally driven by the balance between incoming solar (shortwave) radiation and outgoing terrestrial (longwave) radiation. The sun provides essentially all the energy that drives weather and climate. This solar energy heats the surface, which then radiates energy back to space as infrared radiation.\nGreenhouse gases in the atmosphere trap some of this outgoing longwave radiation, warming the surface. This greenhouse effect is essential for making Earth habitable—without it, the planet would be about 33°C cooler. However, human activities have increased atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases, creating an energy imbalance.\nRadiative forcing—an imposed change in the balance between absorbed solar and outgoing terrestrial radiation—drives climate change by creating an energy imbalance. That imbalance is gradually reduced through increased outgoing radiation as the planet warms and through heat storage, especially in the oceans. Climate sensitivity, the equilibrium temperature response to doubled atmospheric CO₂, remains uncertain but is estimated at 2.5–4.0°C. This uncertainty about the magnitude of warming from a given forcing propagates through climate projections.\nThis fundamental warming directly intensifies the global water cycle. The amount of water vapor the atmosphere can hold is governed by the Clausius–Clapeyron equation, which dictates a roughly 7% increase in moisture per degree Celsius of warming.

These planetary circulation systems create the framework within which all weather and climate variability occurs.\nAtmospheric circulation includes the Hadley cells that transport heat from the equator toward the poles, creating trade winds and the Intertropical Convergence Zone where much of the world’s precipitation occurs. The jet streams, driven by temperature gradients between warm tropics and cold poles, guide the paths of storm systems in midlatitudes. Monsoons represent seasonal shifts in these circulation patterns as land masses heat and cool relative to adjacent oceans.\nOceanic circulation redistributes heat through the thermohaline (meridional overturning) circulation driven by temperature and salinity differences (e.g., the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation, AMOC). The Gulf Stream carries warm water northward along the U.S. East Coast before crossing the Atlantic. The Antarctic Circumpolar Current connects all ocean basins. These currents influence regional climates and can change over time as the climate system evolves.",

These modes of variability represent the primary source of year-to-year climate predictability that risk managers must consider.\nEl Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) exemplifies how ocean–atmosphere interactions create climate variability. Changes in Pacific Ocean temperatures alter atmospheric circulation patterns, affecting precipitation and temperature around the globe. El Niño events typically bring wetter conditions to the southern United States and drier conditions to Australia and Indonesia. La Niña tends to have opposite effects. The phase of ENSO doesn’t determine the weather, but it shifts the probability distributions of temperature and precipitation across many regions.\nAtlantic Multidecadal Variability (AMV; often called AMO) influences hurricane activity and rainfall patterns around the Atlantic basin over 60–80-year periods. The Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) affects climate variability along the Pacific rim. The Arctic Oscillation (AO) influences winter weather patterns across the Northern Hemisphere.\nThese natural modes of variability interact with externally forced long-term climate trends. For example, a strong El Niño event superimposed on a warming climate can create record-breaking temperatures. The timing of natural variability can temporarily mask or amplify underlying climate change signals.",

Understanding these connections requires drawing from several branches of climate science.\nAtmospheric dynamics explains why storms form where they do and how circulation patterns like jet streams influence weather. A meandering jet stream can create atmospheric river events that transport moisture from tropical regions to cause flooding in California. When weather patterns like atmospheric rivers form, they now tap into this thermodynamically enhanced atmospheric moisture, leading to more intense rainfall and a higher flood risk than the same pattern would have produced in a cooler climate. Blocking patterns in the jet stream can create persistent high-pressure systems that lead to heat domes over large regions.\nTropical meteorology focuses on hurricanes, monsoons, and other phenomena that dominate hazards in many regions. Hurricane development requires specific combinations of sea surface temperatures, atmospheric instability, and circulation patterns. Changes in these large-scale conditions affect where storms form, how they track, and how intense they become.\nHydrology examines how precipitation becomes streamflow and how watersheds respond to different rainfall patterns. The same amount of rainfall can produce very different flood responses depending on antecedent soil moisture, snowpack conditions, and the spatial and temporal distribution of precipitation.\nOcean processes affect regional climate through heat transport and moisture sources. Sea surface temperature patterns influence evaporation rates and atmospheric moisture content. Changes in ocean circulation can alter regional temperature and precipitation patterns.",

    "text": "1.6 Sources of uncertainty in climate projections\nAs we move from understanding the past climate to projecting the future, our analysis must account for three distinct sources of uncertainty. These are not interchangeable forms of statistical noise; they arise from different processes and dominate at different time horizons.\n\n1.6.1 Scenario Uncertainty\nThis uncertainty stems from our inability to predict future human activities, primarily greenhouse gas emissions, land-use change, and aerosol concentrations. It is fundamentally a socioeconomic uncertainty, not a physical climate-science uncertainty. Projections are therefore conditioned on a set of plausible futures, or scenarios (e.g., Shared Socioeconomic Pathways, SSPs), each representing a different trajectory of global development. For long-term projections (e.g., post-2050), scenario uncertainty is typically the largest contributor to the total uncertainty in global mean temperature and many regional climate variables.\n\n\n1.6.2 Model Uncertainty\nThis reflects the limitations of our scientific understanding and our ability to represent the climate system numerically. Global Climate Models (GCMs) are based on the fundamental laws of physics, but they must approximate or parameterize processes that are too small or complex to be explicitly resolved, such as cloud formation, ocean turbulence, and vegetation dynamics. Different modeling centers make different, scientifically defensible choices for these parameterizations. The resulting spread in projections from a multi-model ensemble (e.g., CMIP6) represents our structural uncertainty about the true response of the climate system to a given forcing. This is because GCMs must approximate or parameterize processes that are too small or complex to be explicitly resolved, such as individual thunderstorms or cloud formation, leading to scientifically defensible differences between models.\n\n\n1.6.3 Internal Variability\nThis is the natural, unforced variability inherent in the chaotic climate system. It arises from the complex, nonlinear interactions between the atmosphere, oceans, land, and ice. Phenomena like the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) or the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) are expressions of this internal variability. Even with a perfect model and a perfectly known future emissions scenario, the precise timing of these natural fluctuations is not predictable beyond a few weeks or months. This aleatoric (inherent randomness) uncertainty is the dominant source of uncertainty for projections on short time horizons (e.g., the next 10–20 years), as natural climate swings can easily mask or amplify the long-term forced trend.",

    "text": "1.7 Statistical characteristics of climate hazards\nClimate hazards exhibit statistical properties that challenge traditional risk assessment approaches. Understanding why these challenges arise connects the physical climate science we’ve just described to the probabilistic methods needed for risk assessment.\n\n1.7.1 Properties that challenge traditional approaches\nThe physical processes described above create several statistical characteristics that make standard statistical methods problematic.\nExtreme events occur more frequently than a normal distribution predicts. This heavy-tailed (“fat-tailed”) behavior emerges from the nonlinear dynamics of atmospheric and oceanic systems, such as the blocking patterns and atmospheric river events described earlier. Small changes in initial conditions or boundary forcing can lead to disproportionately large changes in outcomes. This has profound implications for infrastructure design based on return periods and for insurance mechanisms that assume lighter-tailed distributions.\nClimate change violates the stationarity assumption that underlies most traditional statistical analysis, because, as discussed, radiative forcing from greenhouse gases is altering the fundamental energy balance of the planet. Statistical properties do not remain constant over time. Mean values change as global temperatures rise. Variability patterns shift as circulation patterns evolve. The modes of climate variability we described—ENSO, AMV—may themselves change in a warming climate.\nThe multi-scale nature of climate processes creates challenges for statistical analysis. Interannual variability like ENSO affects weather patterns globally over 2–7-year cycles. Decadal patterns can dominate regional climate for decades. This means that short observational records may miss important modes of variability that could affect risk assessment. Each source of uncertainty—internal variability, model uncertainty, and scenario uncertainty—contributes to uncertainty in the posterior predictive distributions used for decisions.\nExtreme events often affect large regions simultaneously, challenging assumptions of spatial independence that underlie many risk models, because planetary-scale circulation patterns like the jet stream and modes of variability like ENSO create spatial coherence in climate anomalies. Heat waves can span entire continents when jet stream patterns create persistent blocking. Droughts affect multiple countries within a river basin when large-scale circulation anomalies reduce precipitation over wide areas. Understanding and modeling these spatial dependencies requires methods covered in Correlation and Dimensionality.\n\n\n1.7.2 Implications for climate information\nThese characteristics, rooted in the physics of the climate system, create requirements for climate information that supports decision-making. Climate characterizations should be consistent with known physical processes rather than purely statistical constructs. They should provide sufficient spatial and temporal resolution for the impact assessment at hand. Large ensembles help quantify the uncertainty sources described above rather than providing single-valued projections. Multiple plausible scenarios acknowledge deep uncertainties about future emissions, policies, and system responses.",

    "text": "1.8 Using Climate Models in Risk Assessment\n\n1.8.1 The uncertainty cascade\nClimate impact projections involve an uncertainty cascade from emissions to impacts. Different socioeconomic pathways lead to different greenhouse gas concentrations. Climate sensitivity—the global temperature response to doubled CO₂—remains uncertain, with current estimates ranging from 2.5-4.0°C. Global temperature changes translate to regional climate patterns through complex atmospheric and oceanic dynamics. Regional climate changes then drive local impacts through sector-specific models for floods, droughts, agriculture, and other consequences.\nUncertainty compounds at each step. For near-term projections (2030), internal climate variability often dominates uncertainty, meaning that natural fluctuations can mask or amplify climate change signals. For long-term projections (2100), scenario uncertainty becomes most important, as different emissions pathways lead to dramatically different climate outcomes. At regional scales and for extreme events, model uncertainty often dominates throughout the century.\nClimate models are evaluated against historical observations, process understanding, and paleoclimate data. A model that reproduces observed climate trends and captures realistic physical mechanisms provides more confidence for future projections. However, good historical performance doesn’t guarantee accurate future projections, especially for unprecedented conditions or potential tipping point behaviors that lie outside historical experience.",

Probabilistic inference is fundamentally about learning from data to make decisions under uncertainty.\nFollowing Gelman et al. (2014), we can organize all of probabilistic modeling into three essential steps:\n\nSet up a full probability model: Define a joint probability distribution for all observable and unobservable quantities in your problem\nCondition on observed data: Calculate the posterior distribution of unknown quantities given what you’ve observed\nEvaluate the fit and implications: Check how well the model captures reality and what it implies for decisions\n\nThis three-step workflow applies whether you’re estimating flood return periods, projecting future hurricane intensities, or evaluating adaptation strategies. Let’s see this in action with a simple example before diving into the mathematical machinery.\n\n2.1.1 A simple example: Coin flipping\nLet’s start with the simplest possible example to illustrate the three-step workflow. Suppose you have a coin and want to know if it’s fair. This simple model is analogous to many real-world risk problems: for example, asking if a given year has a ‘high’ or ‘low’ chance of experiencing a major flood based on a complex climate model’s binary prediction. In both cases, we have a binary outcome and want to infer the underlying probability.\nStep 1 - Set up the model: - Parameter of interest: \\(\\theta\\) = probability the coin lands heads - Prior belief: maybe the coin is fair, so \\(\\theta\\) could be around 0.5 - Data model: each flip follows \\(\\text{Bernoulli}(\\theta)\\)\nStep 2 - Learn from data: You flip the coin 10 times and observe 7 heads. Use Bayes’ theorem to update your belief about \\(\\theta\\).\nStep 3 - Make decisions: Based on your posterior distribution for \\(\\theta\\), decide whether the coin is likely fair or biased.\nThis simple example captures the essence of probabilistic inference. We’ll formalize this logic throughout the chapter, then apply it to much more complex climate risk problems.",

    "text": "2.2 The language of uncertainty\nWe assume you have taken courses in probability and statistics and are familiar with basic concepts. This section provides a focused review of essential foundations, emphasizing how they serve probabilistic inference for climate risk. For more mathematical details, Michael Betancourt’s writing is an outstanding resource.\n\n2.2.1 General notation for statistical inference\nBefore developing the theory, let’s establish clear notation that we’ll use throughout the book. Following Gelman et al. (2014), we distinguish three types of quantities:\n\nParameters (\\(\\theta\\)): Unknown quantities we want to learn about (e.g., the true 100-year flood level, hurricane intensity parameters, or climate sensitivity)\nObserved data (\\(y\\)): Quantities we have measured (e.g., historical flood heights, satellite temperature measurements, or storm track records)\nUnobserved predictions (\\(\\tilde{y}\\)): Unknown but potentially observable quantities (e.g., next year’s maximum temperature, future sea level, or the outcome of a proposed adaptation strategy)\n\nThe joint probability model \\(p(\\theta, y, \\tilde{y})\\) describes our beliefs about all these quantities and their relationships. This joint distribution is the central object in probabilistic inference—everything else flows from asking questions of this distribution.\nFor climate risk assessment, \\(\\theta\\) might represent physical parameters like climate sensitivity or return period parameters, \\(y\\) represents our historical observations and measurements, and \\(\\tilde{y}\\) represents future climate conditions we need to predict for planning.\n\n\n2.2.2 Exchangeability\nA fundamental assumption underlying most statistical models is exchangeability: the idea that we can learn about future observations from past observations because they share some common underlying structure.\nTwo random variables \\(Y_1\\) and \\(Y_2\\) are exchangeable if their joint distribution is unchanged by swapping their labels: \\(p(Y_1, Y_2) = p(Y_2, Y_1)\\). More generally, observations \\(Y_1, \\ldots, Y_n\\) are exchangeable if their joint distribution is invariant under permutations.\nFor climate applications, exchangeability justifies using historical flood records to estimate future flood risk, or using temperature measurements from different years to understand temperature variability. However, exchangeability can break down when the underlying system changes—for instance, due to climate change or urbanization affecting flood patterns. Non-stationarity and climate change impacts on statistical properties are discussed in Fundamentals of Climate Science.\n\n\n2.2.3 Axiomatic foundations\nProbability theory rests on three simple axioms that ensure probabilities behave consistently: they’re non-negative, total probability equals one, and probabilities of mutually exclusive events add up. From these basic rules, we can derive all the mathematical machinery needed for probabilistic inference (Jaynes 2003).\n\n\n2.2.4 Joint distributions\nThe central concept in probabilistic inference is the joint probability distribution. For any problem involving uncertainty, our goal is to specify a joint distribution over all relevant quantities—both observed and unobserved.\nThe joint distribution \\(p(\\theta, y, \\tilde{y})\\) completely characterizes our knowledge state about:\n\nWhat we want to learn (parameters \\(\\theta\\))\nWhat we have observed (data \\(y\\))\n\nWhat we want to predict (future observations \\(\\tilde{y}\\))\n\nEverything else in probabilistic inference involves asking questions of this joint distribution:\n\nLearning from data: \\(p(\\theta | y) \\propto p(\\theta, y)\\) (conditioning)\nMaking predictions: \\(p(\\tilde{y} | y) = \\int p(\\tilde{y}, \\theta | y) d\\theta\\) (marginalization)\nQuantifying decision-relevant quantities: \\(\\mathbb{E}[f(\\theta, \\tilde{y}) | y]\\) (expectation of functions)\n\nThis perspective—that statistical modeling is about building joint distributions—provides the foundation for the computational methods we’ll develop later.\n\n\n2.2.5 Bayes’ theorem\nBayes’ theorem connects the different types of probability statements and provides the foundation for updating beliefs based on evidence. Since joint probability can be decomposed as \\(p(\\theta, y) = p(\\theta) p(y | \\theta) = p(y) p(\\theta | y)\\), we can derive:\n\\[\np(\\theta | y) = \\frac{p(\\theta) p(y | \\theta)}{p(y)}\n\\]\nThis equation has a powerful interpretation: \\(p(\\theta)\\) represents our prior beliefs about parameters \\(\\theta\\), \\(p(y | \\theta)\\) represents the likelihood of observing data \\(y\\) given parameters \\(\\theta\\), and \\(p(\\theta | y)\\) represents our posterior beliefs after seeing the data.\nIn many applications, we work with the proportional form \\(p(\\theta | y) \\propto p(\\theta) p(y | \\theta)\\) since the denominator \\(p(y)\\) doesn’t depend on \\(\\theta\\). This framework is essential for Bayesian inference in climate science, where we often want to update our understanding of physical processes based on observations.",

    "section": "2.3 Using probability models to learn from data",
    "text": "2.3 Using probability models to learn from data\nProbability theory gives us the language for representing uncertainty, but probabilistic inference is about using that language to answer specific questions. Given a joint probability model \\(p(\\theta, y, \\tilde{y})\\), we need computational tools to extract the information relevant for decision-making.\nAll probabilistic inference involves two fundamental operations on the joint distribution:\n\n2.3.1 The two fundamental operations\n\n2.3.1.1 1. Conditioning: Learning from data\nConditioning answers: “How does observing data \\(y\\) change our beliefs about parameters \\(\\theta\\)?”\nWe use Bayes’ theorem to compute the posterior distribution: \\[p(\\theta | y) = \\frac{p(\\theta, y)}{p(y)} = \\frac{p(\\theta) p(y | \\theta)}{\\int p(\\theta) p(y | \\theta) d\\theta}\\]\nThe posterior \\(p(\\theta | y)\\) represents our updated knowledge about \\(\\theta\\) after seeing data \\(y\\). This is the mathematical engine for learning—it tells us how to rationally update our beliefs based on evidence.\nFor climate risk assessment, conditioning might update our beliefs about:\n\nHurricane intensity parameters after observing a new storm season\nFlood return levels after observing recent extreme events\n\nClimate sensitivity parameters after incorporating new temperature data\n\n\n\n2.3.1.2 2. Marginalization: Focusing on what matters\nMarginalization answers: “What do we know about quantity \\(\\theta_1\\) while ignoring nuisance parameters \\(\\theta_2\\)?”\nWe integrate out unwanted variables to focus on quantities of interest: \\[p(\\theta_1 | y) = \\int p(\\theta_1, \\theta_2 | y) d\\theta_2\\]\nThis allows us to extract the uncertainty in specific parameters while averaging over everything else we don’t care about for a particular decision.\nFor example, when estimating flood risk, we might marginalize over uncertain rainfall distribution parameters to focus solely on the flood frequency we need for infrastructure planning.\n\n\n\n2.3.2 Computing expectations\nThese two operations ultimately serve one purpose: computing expectations that inform decisions. When we need to know the probability of an event or the expected value of some quantity of interest, we often need to apply both conditioning and marginalization to extract that information from our joint distribution.\nThe goal of probabilistic inference is computing expectations — probability-weighted averages of quantities we care about. Most decision-relevant quantities can be expressed as an expectation:\n\nThe mean is \\(\\mathbb{E}[X]\\)\nThe variance is \\(\\mathbb{E}[(X - \\mathbb{E}[X])^2]\\)\nThe probability of an event is \\(\\mathbb{E}[\\mathbf{1}_{\\text{event}}]\\) (expectation of an indicator function)\nExpected annual damages from hurricanes integrate over storm intensity, frequency, and damage functions\nFailure probabilities for infrastructure under extreme heat integrate over temperature distributions and failure thresholds\n\nFormally, we want to compute: \\[\\mathbb{E}[g(\\theta, \\tilde{y}) | y] = \\int g(\\theta, \\tilde{y}) p(\\theta, \\tilde{y} | y) d\\theta d\\tilde{y}\\]\nwhere \\(g(\\theta, \\tilde{y})\\) is some function of our parameters and predictions that captures what we need for decision-making.\n\n2.3.2.1 Analytical vs computational approaches\nFor simple models, we can sometimes compute expectations analytically by solving integrals directly. But for the complex, high-dimensional problems typical in climate risk assessment, we need computational approaches:\nMonte Carlo estimation approximates expectations by: 1. Drawing many samples from the probability model: \\((\\theta^{(1)}, \\tilde{y}^{(1)}), \\ldots, (\\theta^{(S)}, \\tilde{y}^{(S)})\\) 2. Computing the function of interest: \\(g(\\theta^{(s)}, \\tilde{y}^{(s)})\\) for each sample 3. Averaging: \\(\\mathbb{E}[g(\\theta, \\tilde{y}) | y] \\approx \\frac{1}{S} \\sum_{s=1}^S g(\\theta^{(s)}, \\tilde{y}^{(s)})\\)\nThis approach forms the foundation for computational methods we’ll develop in subsequent chapters.\n\n\n\n2.3.3 Interpreting probability\nNow that we’ve seen how expectations drive decision-making, it’s worth reflecting on what the probabilities in these expectations mean. This philosophical question becomes crucial when studying extreme events and catastrophic risks that cannot be objectively verified through repeated experimentation.\nFrequentist (objective) interpretation views probability as limiting frequencies of repeatable events. Under this view, statements like “the probability of a category 5 hurricane is 0.02” refer to long-run frequencies we could observe if we repeated the same conditions many times.\nBayesian (subjective/epistemic) interpretation views probability as degrees of belief or states of knowledge. Here, probability statements reflect our uncertainty given available information, even for unique events like “the probability that sea level rise exceeds 1 meter by 2100.”\nFor extreme events and catastrophic risks, the Bayesian interpretation is often more useful because:\n\nMany catastrophic events are rare or unique (we can’t repeat the experiment)\nWe often need to reason about future scenarios that have never occurred\nScientific knowledge combines multiple sources of uncertain information\n\n\n\n2.3.4 Computational approaches\nThe Bayesian framework naturally leads us to computational methods for calculating expectations, since the required integrals are often intractable analytically.\n\n2.3.4.1 Law of large numbers\nThe law of large numbers justifies this approach by formalizing that sample averages converge to true expectations. For independent, identically distributed random variables \\(X_1, X_2, \\ldots\\) with mean \\(\\mu\\): \\[\n\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n X_i = \\mu\n\\]\nFor catastrophic risk assessment, this means:\n\nMonte Carlo estimates of expected annual losses become more accurate with more simulations\nHistorical averages of rare event frequencies converge to true rates (given stationarity)\nComplex expectations over joint distributions of multiple hazards can be reliably estimated\n\nSpatial and temporal dependence in climate data requires specialized methods covered in Correlation and Dimensionality.\nHowever, for extreme events, convergence can be slow due to heavy tails and rare events. Estimating expectations of catastrophic losses may require many thousands of simulations to achieve reasonable accuracy.\n\n\n2.3.4.2 Central limit theorem\nThe law of large numbers tells us that Monte Carlo estimates converge, but how uncertain are our estimates? The central limit theorem quantifies this uncertainty: our sample average \\(\\bar{Y}\\) is approximately normally distributed around the true expectation \\(\\mu\\):\n\\[\\bar{Y} \\sim \\mathcal{N}\\left(\\mu, \\frac{\\sigma^2}{n}\\right)\\]\nFor catastrophic risk assessment, this means we can quantify the Monte Carlo uncertainty in our estimates of expected annual losses, failure probabilities, and other risk metrics. This is crucial for decision-making because it distinguishes between uncertainty in our estimates (which decreases with more simulation) and fundamental uncertainty about the underlying extreme event processes.\nStatistical inference for extreme events involves making conclusions about catastrophic risks from limited data. Two fundamentally different philosophical approaches dominate, each with important implications for how we understand and communicate about rare event risks.\n\n\n2.3.4.3 Frequentist vs Bayesian approaches\nFrequentist inference treats the parameters of extreme event distributions (like hurricane intensity parameters or flood return levels) as fixed but unknown quantities. Under this approach, uncertainty comes from sampling variability—we’d get different parameter estimates if we observed different historical samples. Confidence intervals represent the variability we’d expect across many hypothetical repetitions of the same data collection process.\nBayesian inference treats parameters as random variables representing our knowledge state. Prior distributions encode our beliefs about plausible parameter values (perhaps from physical understanding or regional climate information), which get updated with observed data to produce posterior distributions representing our updated knowledge.\nFor catastrophic risk assessment, the philosophical difference matters:\n\nFrequentist: “Given these fixed (unknown) hurricane parameters, there’s a 5% chance our confidence interval won’t contain the true 100-year return level”\nBayesian: “Given our data and prior knowledge, there’s a 95% probability the 100-year return level lies in this credible interval”\n\n\n\n2.3.4.4 Why Bayesian methods suit extreme events\nBayesian approaches prove particularly valuable for extreme event analysis because:\n\nLimited data: Extreme events are rare, making prior knowledge from physical processes crucial\nDecision focus: Decisions require acting on current knowledge, not hypothetical repetitions\nUnique events: Many catastrophic scenarios (like worst-case sea level rise) are inherently unique\nUncertainty propagation: Complex models benefit from full uncertainty characterization\n\n\n\n2.3.4.5 Hypothesis testing for extremes\nA common practical question is whether observed data are consistent with specific hypotheses about extreme event behavior—for instance, testing whether hurricane intensities show trends or whether flood frequencies have changed. Both frequentist and Bayesian frameworks provide tools for these questions, though they interpret the results differently.",

    "section": "2.4 Probability building blocks",
    "text": "2.4 Probability building blocks\nThe inference framework above relies on several key probability concepts. This section provides the essential building blocks for constructing probability models.\n\n2.4.1 Random variables\nA random variable is a function that assigns numerical values to outcomes of random experiments. We use capital letters (\\(X\\), \\(Y\\), \\(Z\\)) to denote random variables and lowercase letters (\\(x\\), \\(y\\), \\(z\\)) for their specific realizations or values.\nFor catastrophic risk applications, \\(X\\) might represent “maximum storm surge height during a hurricane” and \\(x = 4.2\\) meters would be a specific observation. Continuous random variables (like storm surge heights, wildfire burned area, or drought duration) can take any value in an interval, while discrete random variables (like the annual number of Category 4+ hurricanes or power outage events) take countable values.\n\n\n2.4.2 CDFs, PDFs, and PMFs\nTo work with random variables, we need functions that describe how probability is distributed across possible values.\nThe cumulative distribution function (CDF) answers “what is the probability that \\(X\\) is at most \\(x\\)?”: \\[F_X(x) = \\Pr(X \\leq x)\\]\nFor continuous random variables, we work with probability density functions (PDFs). The density \\(f_X(x)\\) represents probability per unit length, related to the CDF through calculus: \\[F_X(x) = \\int_{-\\infty}^x f_X(u) \\, du \\quad \\text{and} \\quad f_X(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}F_X(x)\\]\nWe calculate probabilities by integrating the PDF over intervals: \\[\\Pr[a \\leq X \\leq b] = \\int_a^b f_X(x) \\, dx\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor continuous random variables, \\(\\Pr(X = x^*) = 0\\) for any specific value \\(x^*\\). Probability is concentrated over intervals, not points.\n\n\n\nDiscrete random variables use probability mass functions (PMFs) instead: \\(p_X(x) = \\Pr(X = x)\\). Unlike continuous variables, discrete variables can assign non-zero probability to individual values.\n\n\n2.4.3 Marginal, conditional, and joint distributions\nCatastrophic events often involve multiple interacting hazards—storm surge and wind speed during hurricanes, temperature and drought severity during heat waves, or rainfall intensity and duration during floods. Understanding these compound extremes requires working with multiple random variables simultaneously. Spatial dependence and correlation structures are explored in detail in Correlation and Dimensionality.\nJoint probability describes multiple extreme events occurring together: \\(p(x, y)\\) for joint densities or \\(\\Pr(X = x, Y = y)\\) for discrete events. This answers questions like “what’s the probability of both extreme storm surge AND category 4+ winds?” — critical for compound hurricane risk.\nMarginal probability focuses on one hazard while ignoring others: \\(p(x)\\) for continuous variables or \\(\\Pr(X = x)\\) for discrete events. For instance, the marginal distribution of wildfire burned area ignores weather conditions, even though they strongly influence fire behavior.\nConditional probability describes one extreme given another has occurred: \\(p(x | y)\\) for conditional densities or \\(\\Pr(X = x | Y = y) = \\frac{\\Pr(X = x, Y = y)}{\\Pr(Y = y)}\\) for discrete events. This answers questions like “given an extreme heat event, what’s the distribution of drought severity?” — essential for cascading risk assessment.\n\n\n2.4.4 Independence\nTwo events \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are independent if knowing that one occurred provides no information about the other. Mathematically, independence means: \\[\\Pr(A \\cap B) = \\Pr(A) \\cdot \\Pr(B)\\]\nEquivalently, for independent events: \\(\\Pr(A | B) = \\Pr(A)\\) and \\(\\Pr(B | A) = \\Pr(B)\\).\nFor random variables \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\), independence means the joint density factorizes: \\(p(x, y) = p(x) \\cdot p(y)\\). This is a strong assumption that often doesn’t hold in climate systems—temperature and precipitation are typically dependent, as are wind speed and atmospheric pressure.\nConditional independence is also important: \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) may be dependent overall but independent given knowledge of a third variable \\(Z\\). This concept is crucial for understanding how climate variables relate through mediating factors.\n\n\n2.4.5 Common probability distributions\nSeveral key distributions appear frequently in catastrophe modeling and extreme event analysis:\n\nThe Poisson distribution \\(Y \\sim \\text{Poisson}(\\lambda)\\) models rare event counts like annual numbers of Category 4+ hurricanes, major earthquakes, or wildfire ignitions over fixed periods.\nThe Negative Binomial distribution handles overdispersed extreme event counts when variance exceeds the mean—common when events cluster in time (like hurricane seasons).\nThe Gamma distribution models positive-valued extremes like maximum daily rainfall amounts, drought durations, and time between major flood events.\nThe Weibull distribution is fundamental for extreme value analysis, modeling phenomena like maximum wind speeds, peak storm surge heights, and infrastructure failure times.\nGeneralized Extreme Value (GEV) and Generalized Pareto (GP) distributions specifically model the statistical behavior of extreme values and exceedances over high thresholds—foundational for catastrophe risk assessment.\n\n\n2.4.5.1 Moments\nThe moments of a distribution characterize its shape and properties—particularly important for understanding extreme event behavior. The first few moments have direct interpretations for catastrophe modeling:\n\nFirst moment (mean): \\(\\mathbb{E}[X] = \\mu\\) - the center of the distribution\nSecond central moment (variance): \\(\\text{Var}(X) = \\mathbb{E}[(X - \\mu)^2] = \\sigma^2\\) - spread around the mean\n\nThird central moment (skewness): measures asymmetry - positive skew indicates long right tails with rare extreme values\nFourth central moment (kurtosis): measures tail heaviness - higher kurtosis means more frequent extreme values\n\nFor catastrophic events, skewness and kurtosis are crucial. Storm surge heights typically show positive skew (most events are small, rare events are catastrophic), while wildfire burned areas often exhibit heavy tails with extreme kurtosis during exceptional fire seasons. The physical processes driving these statistical characteristics are discussed in Fundamentals of Climate Science.",

    "text": "3.1 Overview\nOptimization is the study of finding the best solution to a problem from a set of feasible solutions. Thus, optimization problems typically consist of\n\nA set of decision variables , \\(x\\), which are the inputs we can control (or the “dials” we can turn).\nOne (or more) objective function(s), \\(f(x)\\), which we want to minimize or maximize.\nA set of constraints which define the feasible region.\n\nOptimization is an incredibly diverse field. Problems can have many constraints or none; can have discrete or continuous decision variables (or both); can be static or dynamic; deterministic or stochastic; linear or nonlinear; or much more. When you encounter an optimization problem in the wild, you should always make sure you understand the decision variables (which define what is being optimized), the objective function(s), which define what makes a solution “good”, and the constraints, which define what solutions are being considered. When you build an optimization model, you should always make sure to communicate these three components clearly.\nBecause optimization is a widely studied field, exact solutions to some classes of problems are known, and nearly exact solutions to many others are known. However, these exact solutions often require formulating the problem in a very specific way. Thus, there is generally a trade-off between designing an optimization problem that is (relatively) easy to solve vs. one that represents the relevant system dynamics and uncertainties (relatively) accurately. Consequently, converting a decision problem into an optimization problem is somewhat of an art form, rather than an exact science; this is largely the field of operations research.",

    "text": "3.2 Motivation: Inference\nOne common application of optimization is in statistics. Specifically, we often want to evaluate how consistent the data are with different values of the parameters, and to find the values of the parameters that are most consistent with the data.\n\n3.2.1 General Case\n\n3.2.1.1 Likelihood\nThe likelihood is the probability of the observations \\(y\\) given some parameters \\(\\theta\\): \\[\np(y | \\theta)\n\\]\nOften, we want to study how the likelihood changes for different values of \\(\\theta\\), holding \\(y\\) fixed. This is just \\(p(y | \\theta)\\) for a range of \\(\\theta\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou will sometimes see this referred to as \\(\\mathcal{L}(\\theta)\\). However, since this is a probability distribution, it doesn’t really need its own notation.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2.1.2 Likelihood function for multiple observations\nOften, we have multiple observations \\(y_1, y_2, \\ldots, y_n\\).\nIndependent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) assumption: \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\np(y_1, y_2, \\ldots, y_n) &= p(y_1) p(y_2) \\times \\ldots \\times p(y_n)\\\\\n&= \\prod_{i=1}^n p(y_i)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nUsually we have more than one data point. Say we measure \\(y = y_1, y_2, \\ldots, y_n\\): \\[\np(y | \\theta) = \\prod_{i=1}^n p(y_i | \\theta)\n\\]\n\n\n3.2.1.3 Log trick\nRecall: \\(\\log(AB) = \\log(A) + \\log(B)\\) or, more generally, \\[\n\\log \\left( \\prod_{i=1}^n f_i \\right) = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\log(f_i)\n\\]\nThus, we can work with the “log likelihood”: \\[\n\\log p(y | \\theta) =  \\log \\left( \\prod_{i=1}^n p(y_i | \\theta) \\right) = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\log \\left( p(y_i | \\theta) \\right)\n\\]\nAdding small numbers is also more numerically stable than multiplying them\nCan we find the parameters \\(\\theta^*\\) that maximize the likelihood \\(p(y | \\theta)\\)?\n\n\n3.2.1.4 Log likelihood\nWe can use the log likelihood \\(\\log p(y | \\theta)\\) instead of the likelihood \\(p(y | \\theta)\\).\nThe log likelihood is monotonic with the likelihood, so \\[\n\\arg \\max \\log p(y | \\theta) = \\arg \\max p(y | \\theta)\n\\]\nSolving things analytically takes time up-front, but can be much faster to run because you can avoid the optimization step. Consider the (potentially multivariate) Gaussian example with known covariance matrix \\(\\Sigma\\). We want to maximize the likelihood \\[\n\\sum_{i=1}^n p(y_i | \\mu, \\Sigma)\n\\]\nTo maximize, we set its derivative with respect to \\(\\mu\\), which we’ll denote with \\(\\nabla_\\mu\\), to zero: \\[\n\\sum_{i=1}^n \\nabla_\\mu \\log p(y_i | \\mu, \\Sigma) = 0\n\\]\nSubstituting in the multivariate Gaussian likelihood we get: \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n0 & =\\sum_{i=1}^n \\nabla_\\mu \\log \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{(2 \\pi)^d|\\Sigma|}} \\exp \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\left(x_i-\\mu\\right)^{\\top} \\Sigma^{-1}\\left(x_i-\\mu\\right)\\right) \\\\\n& =\\sum_{i=1}^n \\nabla_\\mu\\left(\\log \\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{(2 \\pi)^d|\\Sigma|}}\\right)\\right)+\\log \\left(\\exp \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\left(x_i-\\mu\\right)^{\\top} \\Sigma^{-1}\\left(x_i-\\mu\\right)\\right)\\right) \\\\\n& =\\sum_{i=1}^n \\nabla_\\mu\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\left(x_i-\\mu\\right)^{\\top} \\Sigma^{-1}\\left(x_i-\\mu\\right)\\right)\\\\\n&=\\sum_{i=1}^n \\Sigma^{-1}\\left(x_i-\\mu\\right) \\\\\n0 &= \\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \\mu) \\\\\n\\mu &= \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n x_i\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nYou are not expected to remember the above equations and I won’t ask you to do this derivation in a time-constrained exam. You should understand the general procedure:\n\nwrite down log likelihood for all data points\n\nwrite down likelihood for one data point\nwrite down log likelihood for one data point\nsum over all data points\n\ntake \\(\\frac{d}{d\\theta}\\) and set equal to zero to maximize\nsolve for \\(\\theta^*\\).\n\n\n\n\n3.2.2 Example: Linear Regression\nLet’s consider the generic regression probelem where we have paired observations \\(\\left\\{x_i, y_i\\right\\}_{i=1}^n\\). In general, we can write this regression as \\[\ny_i | \\alpha, \\beta, \\epsilon \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\alpha + x_i \\beta, \\sigma^2)\n\\] where \\(x_i\\) and \\(\\beta\\) may be vectors.\nWe can use the same approach to derive the maximum likelihood estimate for linear regression:\n\nWrite the likelihood for one data point\nWrite the log likelihood for one data point\nWrite the log likelihood for all data points\nTake \\(\\frac{d}{d\\theta}\\) and set equal to zero to maximize\n\nIf you want a walkthrough, see Ryan Adams’s lecture notes starting at about equation 11.\nIf we work through the math, we can show that the log likelihood for the linear regression problem is \\[\n\\log p(y | X, \\beta, \\sigma) = \\frac{N}{2} \\log (2 \\sigma^2 \\pi)  - \\frac{1}{2 \\sigma^2} \\left( X \\beta - y \\right)^T \\left( X \\beta - y \\right)\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLinear algebra notation\n\n\n\nThere is no intercept here! This is a common notation and assumes that the first column of \\(X\\) is all ones. That is equivalent to writing down an intercept, but lets us use linear algebra notation and keep track of fewer variable names\n\n\nFrom this, we can show that terms drop out and \\[\n\\beta^\\text{MLE} = \\arg \\min_\\beta \\left( X \\beta - y \\right)^T \\left( X \\beta - y \\right)\n\\] which is exactly the least squares problem (minimize squared error): \\[\n\\min_{\\theta} \\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - y_i^\\text{pred})^2\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey point\n\n\n\n“Least squares can be interpreted as assuming Gaussian noise, and particular choices of likelihood can be interpreted directly as (usually exponentiated) loss functions” –Adams\n\n\nIf we then want to estimate \\(\\sigma\\), we can estimate the standard deviation of the residuals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComputational examples\n\n\n\nFor detailed computational examples of likelihood functions, MLE estimation, and numerical optimization, see the companion file: Maximum Likelihood Estimation: Computational Examples.\nExamples include: - Plotting likelihood functions for single and multiple data points - Poisson likelihood for count data (tropical cyclone example)\n- Multivariate likelihood surfaces - Numerical optimization with Optim.jl - Linear regression MLE equivalence to least squares",

The key idea is that we can use the gradient of the objective function to find the direction in which to move to improve our solution. This is often called gradient descent. The basic idea is to take a step in the direction of the gradient, which is the direction of steepest ascent. In the simplest case, \\[\n\\Delta x = -\\alpha \\nabla f(x)\n\\] where \\(\\alpha\\) is the step size or learning rate. This is a hyperparameter that we can tune.\nThe primary limitation of gradient descent is that it can get stuck in local minima. This is especially true for non-convex problems, where there may be many local minima. A vast range of techniques, a treatment of which merits a textbook on its own, have been developed to address this issue, including for example the Adam optimizer (Kingma and Ba 2017).\n\n\n3.4.2 Stochastic Optimization\n\n\n3.4.3 Sequential Decision Problems\n\n\n3.4.4 High-Dimensional Optimization",

Apply damage function: \\(d_i = d(h_i)\\) for each sample 3. Analyze the resulting damage samples: \\(\\{d_1, d_2, \\ldots, d_N\\}\\)\nThis approach generalizes to complex, multi-parameter problems where analytical solutions are impossible.",

    "text": "5.1 Machine learning fundamentals\nMachine learning has become an essential tool in hydroclimate hazard assessment, offering powerful methods for pattern recognition, prediction, and data analysis. However, critical engagement with ML-driven products is essential - understanding assumptions, limitations, and appropriate applications.\nThis chapter focuses on fundamental concepts and critical evaluation, with computational notebooks providing practical examples.\n\n5.1.1 Motivating Example\nConsider the fundamental machine learning problem: we want to make predictions about the value of \\(y\\) given some \\(x\\), where the true relationship is unknown.\nSuppose the true function is: \\[\nf(x) = 2x + x \\sin(2 \\pi x)\n\\]\nBut we only observe noisy data and don’t know the true functional form. How do we approximate \\(f\\) from the data?\nThis illustrates the core challenge of machine learning: learning relationships from limited, noisy observations to make predictions on new data.\n\n\n5.1.2 Function Approximation Approaches\n\n5.1.2.1 Parametric Methods\nParametric methods model the function \\(f\\) using parameters \\(\\theta\\). Finding \\(\\hat{f}\\) becomes equivalent to choosing appropriate \\(\\theta\\).\nLinear Regression Example: \\[\ny | X \\sim \\mathcal{N}(X^T \\beta, \\sigma^2 I)\n\\]\nThis is equivalent to: \\[\ny_i | X_i \\sim \\mathcal{N} \\left(\\sum_{j=1}^J X_{ij} \\beta_j, \\sigma^2 \\right)\n\\]\nPoint Estimation vs. Bayesian Inference:\nWe can obtain point estimates rather than full posterior distributions: - Maximum Likelihood Estimate (MLE): \\(\\arg \\max_\\theta p(y | \\theta)\\) - Maximum a Posteriori Estimate (MAP): \\(\\arg \\max_\\theta p(\\theta | y)\\)\nPoint estimates are appropriate when: 1. We need just a plausible value of the parameters 2. We don’t need to carefully quantify parametric uncertainty 3. Computational efficiency is prioritized\n\n\n5.1.2.2 Nonparametric Methods\n\\(K\\) nearest neighbors (KNN) exemplifies nonparametric methods: find the \\(K\\) training examples closest to a given input and return the average output.\nImportant Note: “Nonparametric” doesn’t mean no parameters—\\(K\\) is still a parameter that must be chosen!\nAdvantages: Flexible, makes few assumptions about functional form Disadvantages: Can be sensitive to local data density, curse of dimensionality\n\n\n\n5.1.3 Loss Functions\nWe need to define what constitutes a “best” approximation through loss functions that measure differences between predicted and actual values.\nCommon Loss Functions:\n\nMean Squared Error (MSE): \\(L(y, \\hat{y}) = (y - \\hat{y})^2\\)\n\nEmphasizes larger errors but sensitive to outliers\n\nMean Absolute Error (MAE): \\(L(y, \\hat{y}) = |y - \\hat{y}|\\)\n\nLess sensitive to outliers, non-differentiable at zero\n\nHuber Loss: Combines MSE and MAE with threshold parameter \\(\\delta\\): \\[\nL_\\delta(y, \\hat{y}) = \\begin{cases}\n\\frac{1}{2}(y - \\hat{y})^2 & \\text{for } |y - \\hat{y}| \\leq \\delta \\\\\n\\delta \\left( |y - \\hat{y}| - \\frac{1}{2}\\delta \\right) & \\text{otherwise}\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\nQuantile Loss: Tailored to specific quantiles \\(\\tau\\), useful for asymmetric errors: \\[\nL_\\tau(y, \\hat{y}) = \\begin{cases}\n\\tau(y - \\hat{y}) & \\text{if } (y - \\hat{y}) &gt; 0 \\\\\n(\\tau - 1)(y - \\hat{y}) & \\text{otherwise}\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\n\n\n\n5.1.4 Bias-Variance Tradeoff\nEvery model error can be decomposed as: \\[\n\\text{MSE} = \\text{Bias}^2 + \\text{Variance} + \\text{Irreducible Error}\n\\]\nBias: How much on average are predicted values different from actual values? \\[\n\\text{Bias}(\\hat{f}(x)) = E[\\hat{f}(x) - f(x)]\n\\]\nVariance: How much does prediction vary between different model realizations? \\[\n\\text{Variance}(\\hat{f}(x)) = E[\\hat{f}(x)^2] - E[\\hat{f}(x)]^2\n\\]\nIrreducible Error: Noise inherent in real-world data that cannot be removed.\nKey Insight: Bayesian methods address this tradeoff through priors that add bias but often reduce variance.\n\n\n5.1.5 Regularization\nRidge Regression includes an L2 penalty to discourage overly complex models: \\[\nL(\\beta) = \\| Y - X^T \\beta \\|_2^2 + \\lambda \\| \\beta \\|_2^2\n\\]\nLasso Regression uses an L1 penalty that can set coefficients to exactly zero: \\[\nL(\\beta) = \\| Y - X^T \\beta \\|_2^2 + \\lambda \\| \\beta \\|_1\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\lambda\\) controls the regularization strength.\n\n\n5.1.6 Supervised Learning\nSupervised learning involves learning from labeled data (inputs and desired outputs). Given paired data \\(\\{(X_i, y_i) \\mid i = 1, 2, \\ldots, n\\}\\) where \\(X_i\\) are predictors and \\(y_i\\) are targets, the goal is to approximate a function \\(f\\) that provides good predictions on new data.\n\n5.1.6.1 Regression\nPredicting continuous hazard variables (e.g., flood depth, streamflow, precipitation amounts). The challenge is modeling relationships between predictors and continuous outcomes while handling uncertainty and avoiding overfitting.\n\n\n5.1.6.2 Classification\nPredicting categorical hazard outcomes (e.g., landslide occurrence, drought severity class, flood/no-flood). Often involves probability estimation rather than just binary decisions, which is crucial for risk assessment applications.\n\n\n\n5.1.7 Unsupervised Learning\nLearning patterns from data without explicit target variables. Common applications include dimensionality reduction, clustering similar climate patterns, and exploratory data analysis.\n\n\n5.1.8 Model Evaluation and Validation\n\n5.1.8.1 Hyperparameters\nMany ML models have nested parameters called “hyperparameters”:\n\nParameters: Learned during model fitting (e.g., where to partition regions in trees)\nHyperparameters: Must be chosen before training (e.g., number of trees in a forest)\n\nHyperparameters are not optimized during model training and require separate tuning strategies.\n\n\n5.1.8.2 Cross-Validation\nKey idea: Evaluate models on data not used for fitting (out of sample).\nK-fold Cross-Validation Process: 1. Split data into \\(K\\) folds 2. For each fold \\(k = 1, \\ldots, K\\): - Fit model on all folds except the \\(k\\)-th - Evaluate model on the \\(k\\)-th fold 3. Average performance across all folds\nCross-validation reduces variance in performance estimates, but cross-validated estimates can still be biased due to hyperparameter overfitting.\n\n\n5.1.8.3 Train-Test Split\nFor unbiased performance assessment: 1. Split data into training (70-80%) and test (20-30%) sets - For spatially/temporally structured data, use structured splits 2. Fit model on training set (including cross-validation for hyperparameter tuning) 3. Final evaluation on test set as last step\nThis provides an honest estimate of model performance on truly unseen data.\n\n\n5.1.8.4 Grid Search\nSimple hyperparameter optimization approach: 1. Predefine a set of \\(S\\) hyperparameter combinations 2. For each combination, fit the model using cross-validation 3. Choose the best-performing model\nMore sophisticated approaches include random search and Bayesian optimization.",

We have binary outcomes (fire occurred or not) and want to model the probability of occurrence.\nFor each data point, we use a Bernoulli distribution: \\[\ny_i \\sim \\mathrm{Bernoulli}(p_i)\n\\]\nThe challenge: we need \\(p_i \\in (0, 1)\\) but linear predictors \\(\\alpha + \\beta x_i \\in (-\\infty, \\infty)\\).\n\n5.3.3.1 Logit Link Function\nThe canonical link function is the logit: \\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\textrm{logit}(p_i) &= \\alpha + \\beta x_i \\\\\n\\log \\frac{p_i}{1 - p_i} &= \\alpha + \\beta x_i \\\\\np_i &= \\frac{\\exp(\\alpha + \\beta x_i)}{1 + \\exp(\\alpha + \\beta x_i)}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThis maps the linear space \\((-\\infty, \\infty)\\) onto the probability space \\((0, 1)\\).\n\n\n5.3.3.2 Alternative Link Functions\nOther link functions exist, such as the probit link (inverse of standard normal CDF), popular in economics. The choice can affect tail behavior and interpretation.\n\n\n\n5.3.4 Poisson Regression: Wildlife Sightings Example\nFor count data (e.g., number of wildlife sightings, flood events), Poisson regression is appropriate: \\[\ny_i \\sim \\mathrm{Poisson}(\\lambda_i)\n\\]\nThe canonical link function is logarithmic: \\[\n\\log(\\lambda_i) = \\alpha + \\beta x_i\n\\]\nThis ensures \\(\\lambda_i &gt; 0\\) (required for Poisson) while allowing linear relationships on the log scale.\n\n\n5.3.5 Implementation in Julia\nGLMs can be implemented using Bayesian frameworks like Turing.jl:\n@model function logistic_regression(y::AbstractVector, x::AbstractVector)\n    α ~ Normal(0, 1)\n    β ~ Normal(0, 1)\n    for i in eachindex(y)\n        p = logistic(α + β * x[i])\n        y[i] ~ Bernoulli(p)\n    end\nend\n\n\n5.3.6 Other GLM Families\n\nNegative Binomial regression: For overdispersed count data\nRobust regression: Using t-distributions for heavy-tailed errors\nGamma regression: For positive continuous data with non-constant variance\n\n\n\n5.3.7 Semi-parametric Methods",

Folsom Dam was built as a multi-purpose structure in 1945. The system of dam and dikes was designed to provide Sacramento with flood protection at a level between the 200- to 500-year return period flood as estimated from the 1912 to 1942 annual maximum flood data. There have now been 6 annual maximum floods larger than the largest observed in the pre-dam construction period. As a result, if the recent data is used, the estimated flood protection is below FEMA’s nominal level of 100 years, which makes the property in Sacramento uninsurable for flood risk. Moving windows of two different lengths are used to estimate the 100-year flood using the Log-Normal distribution. The estimate is reported at the center of each moving window. The 21-year moving window shows nearly a four-fold increase in the magnitude of the 100-year flood over time, with most of the increase coming in the period after 1940. The 51-year window shows a 1.8-fold increase in the estimated 100-year flood magnitude, with a nearly monotonic increase starting post-dam construction. Are the changes just due to chance? Do they reflect changes in the basin, leading to higher floods with the same rainfall? Do they reflect changes in global climate?\n\n\n6.2.5.2 Mann-Kendall\nThere’s an example in Helsel et al.

Get \\(X_{n \\times k}\\), \\(k &lt; p\\).\nYou will lose some information in \\(A\\) that is not in \\(X\\)\nbalancing act betwen clarity of represenation (ease of understanding) vs loss of relevant information\n\n\n6.3.3.1 Principal Component Analysis (PCA)\nOverview and Motivation:\nHigh-dimensional data presents several challenges: - Difficult to visualize and interpret - Contains redundant or irrelevant dimensions - Computational challenges in high dimensions (“curse of dimensionality”) - Need to identify meaningful patterns in complex datasets\nPCA addresses these challenges by finding low-dimensional representations that preserve as much variation as possible in the original data.\nMathematical Foundation:\nFor \\(n\\) observations and \\(p\\) features \\(X_1, X_2, \\ldots, X_p\\), PCA finds a low-dimensional representation that captures maximum variance.\nThe first principal component is the linear combination of features that maximizes variance: \\[Z_1  = \\phi_{11}X_1 + \\phi_{21}X_2 + \\ldots + \\phi_{p1}X_p\\]\nwith normalization constraint: \\(\\sum_{j=1}^p \\phi_{j1}^2 = 1\\)\nThe loading vector \\(\\phi_1 = (\\phi_{11}, \\phi_{21}, \\ldots, \\phi_{p1})^T\\) defines a direction in feature space along which the data vary the most.\nPCA as an Optimization Problem:\nWe can formulate PCA as finding the best linear approximation to the data: \\[f(Z) = \\mu + \\phi_q Z\\]\nwhere: - \\(\\mu\\) is a location vector (typically zero for centered data) - \\(\\phi_q\\) is a \\(p \\times q\\) matrix with \\(q\\) orthogonal unit vectors as columns - \\(Z\\) is a \\(q\\)-dimensional vector of coefficients or scores\nThe optimization problem becomes: \\[\\min \\sum_{i=1}^n \\| X_i - \\phi_q Z_i \\|_2^2\\]\nConnection to Singular Value Decomposition (SVD):\nThe solution can be written as a singular value decomposition of the empirical covariance matrix. This assumes that variance is an appropriate measure of variability in the data.\nImportant caveat: This assumption may be poor when: - Variables have very different scales - Outliers are present - Non-Gaussian distributions where variance doesn’t capture the relevant structure\nUniqueness and Interpretation:\nEach principal component loading vector is unique up to a sign flip. The choice of sign is arbitrary and doesn’t affect the interpretation.\nClimate Science Applications:\nIn climate science, we commonly work with space-time data where PCA components can be interpreted as:\n\nSpatial patterns (\\(Z\\)): The “EOFs” (Empirical Orthogonal Functions) or principal components represent dominant spatial patterns of variability\nTime series (\\(\\phi\\)): The loadings represent time evolution of each spatial pattern\nData reconstruction: Can reconstruct the full field at time \\(t\\) from the EOFs and their time series\n\nPreprocessing Considerations:\nCentering: - Variables should have mean zero for standard PCA - Variance is the average squared deviation from the mean - Centered and non-centered data will have different covariance matrices\nStandardization: - Optional: standardize variables to unit variance - Important when variables have different units or scales - Equivalent to weighting variables by inverse of their variances\nClimate Anomalies: In climate science, it’s common to decompose time series into climatology and anomalies: \\[x(t) = \\overline{x}(t) + x'(t)\\] where \\(\\overline{x}(t)\\) is the climatology and \\(x'(t)\\) is the anomaly.\nCommon approaches for defining climatology: 1. Time-mean over a reference period 2. Seasonal climatology computed separately for each month or season (DJF, MAM, JJA, SON) 3. Harmonic climatology with seasonal cycle removed using sinusoidal terms\nSpatial Data Considerations:\nWeighting: - Area weighting: Use \\(\\sqrt{\\cos(\\phi)}\\) where \\(\\phi\\) is latitude to weight by grid cell area - Variance weighting: Weight by inverse variance (equivalent to standardization) - Physical considerations: Weight variables based on measurement uncertainty or physical importance\nModel Selection:\nHow Many Components to Retain? - Scree plot: Look for “elbow” where eigenvalues level off - Cumulative variance: Retain components explaining desired percentage (e.g., 90%) - Cross-validation: Choose number based on out-of-sample performance - Physical interpretation: Retain components with clear physical meaning\nComputational Implementation:\nJulia Packages: - EmpiricalOrthogonalFunctions.jl: Climate-focused PCA/EOF analysis, based on Python’s EOFS library - MultivariateStats.jl: General-purpose multivariate statistics including PCA\nPractical Workflow:\nusing EmpiricalOrthogonalFunctions\n\n# Assume data matrix with time × space structure\nsolver = EmpiricalOrthogonalFunctions.Eof(data)\n\n# Get EOFs (spatial patterns)\neofs = solver.eofs()\n\n# Get principal components (time series)  \npcs = solver.pcs()\n\n# Get explained variance\nvariance = solver.varianceFraction()\nExtensions and Advanced Methods:\nProbabilistic PCA: Provides probabilistic framework with uncertainty quantification Robust PCA: Less sensitive to outliers and non-Gaussian distributions\nSparse PCA: Produces interpretable loadings with many zero entries Canonical Correlation Analysis: Analyzes relationships between two sets of variables\nClimate Applications:\nMode Analysis: Identify dominant climate variability patterns (ENSO, NAO, etc.) Model Evaluation: Compare spatial patterns between observations and climate models Dimension Reduction: Reduce high-dimensional climate model output for analysis Data Compression: Efficiently store and transmit large climate datasets\nFurther Reading:\n\nSVD Mathematical Overview by Steven Brunton provides conceptual SVD overview\nMIT Computational Thinking PCA Lecture\nChapter 10.2 of James et al.

    "text": "7.3 Information criteria\n\n7.3.1 The Fundamental Problem\nWe want to make probabilistic predictions about unobserved data \\(\\tilde{y}\\). The challenge is balancing: - Complexity: More parameters can better fit observed data - Overfitting: Complex models may perform poorly on new data - Parsimony: Simpler models are more interpretable and robust\n\n\n7.3.2 Predictive Accuracy Framework\nWe define predictive performance using a utility function, commonly the log predictive density: \\[\n\\overline{u}(M) = \\mathbb{E}[\\log p(\\tilde{y} | D, M)] = \\int p_t(\\tilde{y}) \\log p(\\tilde{y} | D, M) d\\tilde{y}\n\\] where \\(p_t(\\tilde{y})\\) is the true data generating distribution (unknown!).\nMaximizing this expected utility is equivalent to minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence between our model and the true data-generating process.\n\n7.3.2.1 Kullback-Leibler Divergence\nThe KL divergence measures how similar two distributions are: \\[\nD_\\text{KL} (P \\parallel Q) = \\sum_{x \\in \\mathcal{X}} P(x) \\log \\left[ \\frac{P(x)}{Q(x)} \\right]\n\\]\nOne interpretation of \\(D_\\text{KL} (P \\parallel Q)\\) is the measure of information gained by revising one’s beliefs from the prior distribution \\(Q\\) to the posterior distribution \\(P\\). Another interpretation is the amount of information lost when \\(Q\\) is used to approximate \\(P\\).\n\n\n7.3.2.2 Working with Estimates\nIn practice, we don’t know the true distribution, so we approximate the log pointwise predictive density (lppd): \\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\text{lppd} &= \\log \\prod_{i=1}^N p_\\text{post}(y_i) = \\sum_{i=1}^N \\log \\int p(y_i | \\theta) p_\\text{post} (\\theta) d \\theta \\\\\n&\\approx \\sum_{i=1}^N \\log \\left[ \\frac{1}{S} \\sum_{s=1}^S p(y_i | \\theta^s) \\right]\n\\end{align}\n\\] where we have approximated the posterior with \\(S\\) simulations from the posterior (e.g., using MCMC).\nThe LPPD of observed data \\(y\\) is an overestimate of the expected LPPD for future data, which is why information criteria include bias corrections.\n\n\n\n7.3.3 Akaike Information Criterion (AIC)\nFor models with \\(k\\) parameters estimated by maximum likelihood: \\[\n\\text{AIC} = 2k - 2\\ln\\hat{\\mathcal{L}}\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\hat{\\mathcal{L}}\\) is the maximized likelihood.\nKey assumptions: - Parameters are asymptotically normal - Residuals are independent given parameter estimates - Sample size is large relative to number of parameters\n\n\n7.3.4 Deviance Information Criterion (DIC)\nExtends AIC to Bayesian settings by: 1. Replacing MLE with posterior mean: \\(\\hat{\\theta}_{\\text{Bayes}} = \\mathbb{E}[\\theta | y]\\) 2. Using data-based bias correction for effective parameters\n\\[\n\\text{DIC} = -2\\log p(y | \\hat{\\theta}_{\\text{Bayes}}) + 2p_{\\text{DIC}}\n\\]\n\n\n7.3.5 Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC)\nTakes a different approach, approximating the marginal likelihood: \\[\n\\text{BIC} = k\\ln(n) - 2\\ln\\hat{\\mathcal{L}}\n\\]\nAssuming a “true model” exists, BIC tends to select simpler models than AIC.\n\n\n7.3.6 Significance Criteria\nUse Null Hypothesis Significance Testing (NHST) to decide whether to include a variable. For example, should we add a trend term in our regression?\n\nForm a null hypothesis: \\(\\beta = 0\\)\nTest statistics ⇒ \\(p\\)-value\nIf \\(p &lt; \\alpha\\) then use \\(M_2\\) else use \\(M_1\\)\n\nNote that: - This is equivalent to Bayes factor in certain contexts - Still assumes existence of a true model (hence the many problems with NHST) - This is widely used in practice, often without justification",

    "text": "8.5 Terminology and Key Concepts\n\n8.5.1 Return Periods and Levels\nFundamental concepts for communicating extreme value results:\n\nExceedance probability: \\(p\\) = probability of exceeding a level in any given year\nReturn period/recurrence interval: \\(T = 1/p\\) = average time between exceedances\n\nReturn level: Value exceeded with probability \\(1/T\\) = quantile corresponding to return period \\(T\\)\n\nExample: 100-year flood has: - Exceedance probability: \\(p = 0.01\\) (1% chance per year) - Return period: \\(T = 100\\) years - Return level: Discharge exceeded on average once per century\nImportant: Return period is an average - a 100-year event can occur multiple times in a decade or not at all for centuries.\n\n\n8.5.2 Plotting Positions\nFor visualization, need to assign return periods to observed data:\n\nRanks: Largest observation = rank 1, second largest = rank 2, etc.\nWeibull plotting position: \\(p = m/(N+1)\\) where \\(m\\) = rank, \\(N\\) = sample size\nReturn period: \\(T = 1/p = (N+1)/m\\)\n\nNote: Various plotting position formulas exist in literature - choice affects visualization but not fitted model parameters.\n\n\n8.5.3 Threshold Selection\nCentral challenge: Balance bias vs. variance - Too low: Model not asymptotically valid → bias - Too high: Few exceedances → large uncertainty\n\n\n8.5.4 Mean Residual Life Plot\nBased on GPD mean excess property:\nIf \\(Y_i \\sim \\text{GPD}(\\sigma, \\xi)\\), then the mean is given by \\[\n\\mathbb{E}[Y] = \\frac{\\sigma}{1 - \\xi}, \\quad \\xi &lt; 1.\n\\tag{8.1}\\]\nFor threshold exceedances: \\[\n\\mathbb{E}[X - u | X &gt; u] = \\frac{\\sigma_u}{1 - \\xi}, \\quad \\xi &lt; 1\n\\tag{8.2}\\]\nIf GPD is appropriate above threshold \\(u_0\\), then mean excess should be approximately linear in \\(u\\) for \\(u &gt; u_0\\). This forms the basis of the “mean residual life plot” - subjective but useful diagnostic.\n\n\n8.5.5 Parameter Stability Plot\nAlternative approach: estimate GPD parameters for range of thresholds. Shape parameter \\(\\xi\\) should be approximately constant above appropriate threshold.\n\n\n8.5.6 Declustering\nProblem: Successive threshold exceedances may be dependent (e.g., multi-day storms) Solution: “Decluster” by combining nearby exceedances or imposing minimum separation\nMethods: - Runs declustering: Combine exceedances separated by &lt; threshold for &lt; specified duration - Peak identification: Extract local maxima with minimum separation\nPractical consideration: Balance between removing dependence and preserving extreme values.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.1: Mean Residual Life Plot for extreme rainfall data\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.2: Return Period with Uncertainty\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.5.7 Parameter Estimation\nSeveral approaches exist for fitting extreme value distributions:\n\n8.5.7.1 Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE)\nMost common approach: Find parameters that maximize likelihood of observed data\nAdvantages: - Asymptotically efficient and unbiased - Provides uncertainty estimates via Fisher information - Standard statistical inference procedures apply\nDisadvantages: - Can be unstable for small samples - May not exist for some parameter combinations - Sensitive to outliers\n\n\n8.5.7.2 Probability Weighted Moments (PWM)\nAlternative approach: Match theoretical and sample probability weighted moments\nAdvantages: - Often more robust than MLE for small samples - Computationally simpler - Less sensitive to outliers\nDisadvantages: - Less efficient than MLE asymptotically - Uncertainty quantification more complex\n\n\n8.5.7.3 Bayesian Methods\nModern approach: Specify prior distributions and compute posterior\nAdvantages: - Natural uncertainty quantification - Can incorporate prior knowledge - Regularizes parameter estimates - Handles model selection coherently\nDisadvantages: - Requires prior specification - Computationally intensive - Results depend on prior choice",

    "section": "8.8 Non-Stationary Extreme Value Analysis: Theory and Practice",
    "text": "8.8 Non-Stationary Extreme Value Analysis: Theory and Practice\n\n8.8.1 The Stationarity Assumption and Its Breakdown\nExtreme value theory is based on the assumption that the data are independent and identically distributed (iid): - Each draw comes from the same distribution - Statistical properties remain constant over time\nThis assumption is violated by: - Climate change effects on temperature and precipitation extremes - Low-frequency variability (e.g., Pacific Decadal Oscillation) - Memory processes in the climate system - Urbanization and land use changes\n\n\n8.8.2 What is Stationarity?\nA stationary process is a stochastic process whose unconditional joint probability distribution does not change when shifted in time. A stochastic process is a model for a sequence of random variables (e.g., random walk, MCMC).\nAs famously stated by Milly et al. (2008): “Stationarity is dead.”\n\n\n8.8.3 Climate Change Impacts on Extremes\nThermodynamic Effects: - Clausius-Clapeyron relation: \\(e_s(T) = e_0 \\exp\\left(\\frac{L_v}{R_v T}\\right)\\) - Approximately 7% increase in atmospheric moisture per degree K of warming - Direct impacts on precipitation intensity\nDynamic Effects: - Longer, hotter summers due to slower seasonal transitions - Poleward expansion of tropical circulation patterns - Changes in storm structure and intensity - Shifts in jet stream patterns affecting extreme weather\nThe following content draws from Seneviratne et al. (2021) executive summary:\nClimate Change Impacts on Precipitation: - The frequency and intensity of heavy precipitation events have likely increased at the global scale over a majority of land regions with good observational coverage - Heavy precipitation has likely increased on the continental scale over three continents: North America, Europe, and Asia - Heavy precipitation will generally become more frequent and more intense with additional global warming - At a global warming level of 4°C relative to the pre-industrial level, very rare (e.g., one in 10 or more years) heavy precipitation events would become more frequent and more intense than in the recent past, on the global scale (virtually certain) and in all continents and AR6 regions - The projected increase in the intensity of extreme precipitation translates to an increase in the frequency and magnitude of pluvial floods – surface water and flash floods – (high confidence)\nClimate Change Impacts on River Floods: - Significant trends in peak streamflow have been observed in some regions over the past decades (high confidence) - The seasonality of river floods has changed in cold regions where snow-melt is involved, with an earlier occurrence of peak streamflow (high confidence) - Global hydrological models project a larger fraction of land areas to be affected by an increase in river floods than by a decrease in river floods (medium confidence)\nClimate Change Impacts on Extreme Temperatures: - The frequency and intensity of hot extremes (including heatwaves) have increased, and those of cold extremes have decreased on the global scale since 1950 (virtually certain) - Human-induced greenhouse gas forcing is the main driver of the observed changes in hot and cold extremes on the global scale (virtually certain) and on most continents (very likely) - The frequency and intensity of hot extremes will continue to increase and those of cold extremes will continue to decrease, at global and continental scales and in nearly all inhabited regions with increasing global warming levels\nClimate Change Impacts on Tropical Cyclones: - The average and maximum rain rates associated with tropical cyclones (TCs), extratropical cyclones and atmospheric rivers across the globe, and severe convective storms in some regions, increase in a warming world (high confidence) - It is likely that the global proportion of Category 3–5 tropical cyclone instances has increased over the past four decades - The proportion of intense TCs, average peak TC wind speeds, and peak wind speeds of the most intense TCs will increase on the global scale with increasing global warming (high confidence) - Future wind speed changes are expected to be small, although poleward shifts in the storm tracks could lead to substantial changes in extreme wind speeds in some regions (medium confidence)\nEl Niño-Southern Oscillation Effects: El Niño-Southern Oscillation remains a major driver of interannual climate variability, affecting extreme value statistics through teleconnections that modify regional precipitation and temperature patterns.\n\n\n8.8.4 Non-Stationary Modeling Approaches\nRolling Window Approach: - Simple method that estimates parameters using moving time windows - Advantages: Simple and interpretable - Disadvantages: Noisy estimates, potential loss of extreme events at window boundaries - Less bias but more variance compared to stationary models\nRegression Models for Parameters: In linear regression and GLMs, every data point is drawn from its own distribution that depends on parameters and covariates. We can apply this approach to extreme value models by allowing GEV or GPD parameters to vary with covariates.\nTypes of Parameter Variation: What can vary with time/covariates? 1. Location parameter: \\(\\mu(t) = f(X(t))\\) 2. Scale parameter: \\(\\sigma(t) = f(X(t))\\) 3. Both location and scale parameters 4. Scale and coefficient of variation: \\(\\mu(t) = \\phi \\sigma(t)\\) 5. Varying shape parameter (impractical but theoretically allowed)\nFunctional Forms for Parameter Variation: How parameters vary with covariates: 1. Linear relationships: \\(\\theta(t) = \\alpha + \\beta_1 X_1(t) + \\beta_2 X_2(t) + \\cdots\\) 2. Nonlinear relationships using splines, GAMs, or other flexible approaches 3. Anything is theoretically allowed, but not everything is practical for extreme value analysis\n\n\n8.8.5 Covariate Selection\nGeneral Guidance: - Physical theory and domain knowledge are invaluable for covariate selection - For precipitation extremes, logarithm of CO2 concentration is often a useful covariate because: - It isolates the global warming signal from natural variability like ENSO - It provides a monotonic trend that matches expected thermodynamic responses\nCommon Covariates: - Time (linear or polynomial trends) - Global mean temperature anomalies - Logarithm of atmospheric CO2 concentration - Climate oscillation indices (ENSO, AMO, PDO) - Local environmental variables (sea surface temperatures, soil moisture)\n\n\n8.8.6 Case Study: Houston Hobby Airport Precipitation Analysis\nMotivation: Analysis of trends in extreme precipitation at Houston Hobby Airport demonstrates practical implementation of non-stationary extreme value methods.\nData Considerations: - Annual maximum daily precipitation from NOAA GHCND - Quality control: keep only years with at least 350 days of data - Need to address potential non-stationarity due to climate change\nTrend Analysis: The Mann-Kendall test is commonly used to assess the presence of trends in time series data. Rank correlation between precipitation ranks and years provides initial evidence of trends.\nModel Formulations:\nLocation Trend Model: \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\ny_t &\\sim \\text{GEV} \\left( \\mu_t, \\sigma, \\xi \\right) \\\\\n\\mu_t &= \\alpha + \\beta X_t\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nScale Trend Model: \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\ny_t &\\sim \\text{GEV} \\left( \\mu, \\sigma_t, \\xi \\right) \\\\\n\\log(\\sigma_t) &= \\alpha + \\beta X_t\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nCombined Location and Scale Trend: \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\ny_t &\\sim \\text{GEV} \\left( \\mu_t, \\sigma_t, \\xi \\right) \\\\\n\\mu_t &= \\alpha_\\mu + \\beta_\\mu X_t \\\\\n\\log(\\sigma_t) &= \\alpha_\\sigma + \\beta_\\sigma X_t\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\n\n8.8.7 Implementation Considerations\nComputational Tools: - Extremes.jl package provides gevfitbayes() function with covariate support - Can specify locationcovid and logscalecovid parameters for regression modeling - Default uniform priors may not be ideal - custom priors often needed\nModel Comparison: Comparison between stationary and various non-stationary models helps identify: - Which parameters are most sensitive to climate change - How return level estimates change with different trend assumptions - Uncertainty in future projections under continued warming\n\n\n8.8.8 Key Insights from Non-Stationary Analysis\nBias-Variance Trade-off: - Non-stationary models reduce bias by accounting for trends - But increase variance due to additional parameters to estimate - Physical process knowledge helps guide model selection\nParametric Uncertainty: - Non-stationary models typically have larger parametric uncertainty - Future projections require assumptions about covariate evolution - Model comparison becomes even more critical\nPractical Implications: - Traditional design standards may need updating - Infrastructure planning must account for changing risk profiles - Adaptive management strategies become more important",

    "section": "8.9 Regionalization and Spatial Methods",
    "text": "8.9 Regionalization and Spatial Methods\nMotivation: Single-site records often too short for reliable extreme value analysis\nNearby stations should (usually) have similar precipitation, flood, or other extreme event probabilities. Regionalization methods reduce estimation error by pooling information while reducing sampling error from random variation between nearby stations. However, regionalization does NOT reduce sampling error from major regional events that affect all stations simultaneously.\n\n8.9.1 Classical Regional Frequency Analysis\nL-Moment Estimators: L-moments are linear combinations of order statistics that can be used to match theoretical and empirical distribution moments.\nAdvantages: - Computationally efficient - Work well in practice - Robust parameter estimation\nDisadvantages: - Less flexible than likelihood-based methods - Difficult to quantify parametric uncertainty - Limited ability to incorporate covariates\nRegional Frequency Analysis Process: 1. Assign sites to regions based on climate, geography, or other similarity measures 2. Estimate L-moments for each site using observed data 3. Check for regional homogeneity using statistical tests 4. Take regional L-moments as the weighted mean of site L-moments 5. Apply scaling factors (e.g., average annual maximum flood for each site)\nThis approach is best implemented using the R lmomRFA package, which can be called from Julia using RCall.jl.\n\n\n8.9.2 Region of Influence Approach\nMotivation: RFA assumes all sites are assigned to a single region, but often regions are not distinct.\nMethodology: 1. Define similarity measures between each pair of sites (e.g., distance, land use, elevation, climate indices) 2. For estimates at site i, define its “region of influence” as the most similar sites (analogous to k-nearest neighbors) 3. Estimate L-moments for each site and compute weighted average as in RFA 4. Allow flexible, site-specific regions rather than rigid regional boundaries\nAdvantages: - More flexible than traditional RFA - Can adapt region definition to local characteristics - Better handles sites near regional boundaries\n\n\n8.9.3 Hierarchical Bayesian Models\nModern spatial approaches use hierarchical models to balance between “full pooling” (all sites identical) and “no pooling” (each site independent).\n\n\n8.9.4 Full Pooling Approach\nConcept: Assume within a region, all sites have the same distribution. Estimate a single distribution for the entire region. This is analogous to classical regional frequency analysis.\nBayesian Implementation:\n@model function gev_fully_pooled(y::AbstractMatrix)\n    N_yr, N_stn = size(y)\n    μ ~ Normal(5, 5)\n    σ ~ LogNormal(0, 2)\n    ξ ~ Uniform(-0.5, 0.5)\n    for s in 1:N_stn\n        for t in 1:N_yr\n            if !ismissing(y[t, s])\n                y[t, s] ~ GeneralizedExtremeValue(μ, σ, ξ)\n            end\n        end\n    end\nend\nAdvantages: - Fast sampling due to high data-to-parameter ratio - Simple to implement and interpret - Maximizes information sharing across sites\nImportant Limitation: This approach weights each observation equally, regardless of site or year. If some years have more observations than others, those years are implicitly weighted more heavily. A better model would weight each year equally.\n\n\n8.9.5 Partial Pooling Approach\nConcept: Model parameters at each site as being drawn from a common distribution. This balances between full pooling and no pooling by sharing information while allowing site-specific variation.\nMathematical Framework: \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n    y_{s,t} &\\sim \\text{GEV}(\\mu_s, \\sigma_s, \\xi_s) \\\\\n    \\mu_s &\\sim \\text{Normal}(\\mu^0, \\tau^\\mu) \\\\\n    \\sigma_s &\\sim \\text{LogNormal}(\\sigma^0, \\tau^\\sigma) \\\\\n    \\xi &\\sim \\text{Uniform}(-0.5, 0.5) \\text{ (fully pooled)}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nwhere \\(s\\) is the site index and \\(t\\) is the year index.\nHyperparameters: In Bayesian statistics, hyperparameters like \\(\\mu^0\\) and \\(\\tau^\\mu\\) are learned as part of the model. These describe the distribution from which site-specific parameters are drawn.\nImplementation Example:\n@model function gev_partial_pool(y::AbstractMatrix)\n    N_yr, N_stn = size(y)\n\n    # Define hyperparameters with informative priors\n    μ₀ ~ Normal(5, 3)\n    τμ ~ LogNormal(0, 0.5)\n    σ₀ ~ LogNormal(0.5, 0.5)\n    τσ ~ LogNormal(0, 0.5)\n\n    # Site-specific parameters depend on hyperparameters\n    μ ~ filldist(Normal(μ₀, τμ), N_stn)\n    σ ~ filldist(truncated(Normal(σ₀, τσ), 0, Inf), N_stn)\n\n    # Fully pooled shape parameter\n    ξ ~ Uniform(-0.5, 0.5)\n\n    # Likelihood\n    for s in 1:N_stn\n        for t in 1:N_yr\n            y[t, s] ~ GeneralizedExtremeValue(μ[s], σ[s], ξ)\n        end\n    end\nend\nComputational Considerations: With \\(N\\) stations, we have \\(4 + N + N + 1 = 5 + 2N\\) parameters to estimate, making sampling slower than full pooling. Careful prior specification becomes more important with increased model complexity.\n\n\n8.9.6 Spatial Regression Models\nAlternative Approach: Model parameters as functions of geographical location and environmental covariates. This can simplify the model by reducing the number of parameters to estimate.\nSimple Spatial Model Example: \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n    \\mu(s) &= \\alpha^\\mu + \\beta^\\mu_1 \\cdot \\text{lat}(s) + \\beta^\\mu_2 \\cdot \\text{lon}(s) \\\\\n    \\sigma(s) &= \\alpha^\\sigma + \\beta^\\sigma_1 \\cdot \\text{lat}(s) + \\beta^\\sigma_2 \\cdot \\text{lon}(s) \\\\\n    y_{s,t} &\\sim \\text{GEV}(\\mu(s), \\sigma(s), \\xi)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nExtensions: - Include elevation, distance to coast, climate indices as covariates - Use flexible relationships (splines, GAMs) instead of linear functions - Incorporate spatial correlation through Gaussian process priors - Combine with temporal trends for spatiotemporal modeling\n\n\n8.9.7 Practical Implementation Considerations\nData Challenges: - Missing data requires careful treatment in likelihood calculations - Different record lengths across sites - Need for quality control and homogenization\nModel Selection: - Compare full pooling, partial pooling, and no pooling approaches - Use cross-validation or information criteria - Consider out-of-sample prediction performance\nUncertainty Quantification: - Hierarchical models naturally provide uncertainty estimates - Can propagate parameter uncertainty to return level calculations - Important for decision-making under uncertainty\n\n\n8.9.8 Regional Frequency Analysis\nApproach: Pool information across “similar” sites\n\nIdentify regions: Group sites with similar extreme value behavior\nNormalize data: Scale to common distribution\nFit regional model: Estimate shape parameter regionally\nScale back: Apply regional parameters to individual sites\n\nAdvantages: - Increased effective sample size - More stable parameter estimates - Better extrapolation to rare events\nChallenges: - Defining hydrologically similar regions - Testing regional homogeneity - Accounting for cross-site dependence\n\n\n8.9.9 Modern Spatial Approaches\nHierarchical models: Borrow strength across space while allowing local variation Spatial random effects: Model spatial correlation in extreme value parameters Machine learning: Use environmental covariates to predict extreme value parameters",

    "text": "9.2 Supervised Methods\nSupervised downscaling is especially common in weather forecasting, where we have pairs of (observed, forecasted) data.\n\n9.2.1 Framework\nSupervised downscaling treats the problem as a statistical learning task:\n\nInput: Pairs \\((X_i, y_i)\\) where:\n\n\\(X_i\\): Predictors (e.g., gridded model output)\n\\(y_i\\): Predictand (e.g., station observations)\n\nGoal: Learn function \\(f\\) such that \\(f(X_i) \\approx y_i\\)\nKey requirement: \\(X_i\\) and \\(y_i\\) observed at the same time\n\nQuality is measured through loss functions (e.g., mean squared error, likelihood).\n\n\n9.2.2 Applications\nSupervised methods work well when: - Historical model-observation pairs exist - Relationship between predictors and predictand is stable - Focus is on weather forecasting or hindcasting\nExamples: - Mapping satellite to radar precipitation data - Post-processing numerical weather predictions - Downscaling reanalysis to station observations\n\n\n9.2.3 Example: Linear Regression\nSimplest approach relates large-scale predictors to local observations:\n\\[y = \\beta_0 + \\sum_{j=1}^p \\beta_j X_j + \\epsilon\\]\nwhere \\(X_j\\) might include: - Temperature at multiple pressure levels - Geopotential height gradients - Humidity measures - Previous day’s local weather\nAdvantages: Simple, interpretable, computationally fast Limitations: Assumes linear relationships, may miss complex interactions\n\n\n9.2.4 Example: Model Output Statistics (MOS)\nOperational approach used by weather services:\n\nPreprocessing: Standardize model outputs and observations\nPredictor selection: Choose relevant large-scale variables\nModel fitting: Often multiple linear regression with categorical predictors\nPost-processing: Apply adjustments for known biases\n\nKey insight: MOS exploits systematic model biases to improve forecasts.\n\n\n9.2.5 Example: Generative ML\nModern approach using deep learning:\n\nGenerative Adversarial Networks (GANs): Learn to generate realistic high-resolution fields\nDiffusion models: Model the data generation process through noise injection and removal\nConditional models: Generate outputs conditional on large-scale inputs\n\nGoal: Sample from \\(p(y|X)\\) rather than just predict \\(\\mathbb{E}[y|X]\\)\nAdvantages: Can capture complex nonlinear relationships and full probability distributions Limitations: Computationally intensive, requires large training datasets, difficult to interpret",

    "text": "9.3 Distribution-Based Methods\n\n9.3.1 The Climate Model Challenge\nClimate models present a unique challenge different from weather forecasting. ESMs simulate from the distribution of weather given climate boundary conditions:\n\nRun 100 ESM ensemble members over historical conditions\nStudy December 1, 1980 across all ensemble members\nSome realizations will be rainy, others dry; some cool, others warm\nStatistically meaningful but not deterministic forecasts\n\n\n\n9.3.2 No Paired Data Problem\nUnlike weather forecasting, climate models don’t provide paired observations: - We have samples \\({X_1, \\ldots, X_N}\\) from climate model - We have samples \\({y_1, \\ldots, y_K}\\) from observations - No correspondence between \\(X_i\\) and \\(y_j\\) at specific times\nKey insight: April 15, 1995 in model ≠ April 15, 1995 in observations\nBoth are samples from “distribution of late April weather in 1990s conditions”\n\n\n9.3.3 Distributional Approach\nSince we cannot use supervised methods, we compare distributions:\n\\[p_{\\text{model}}(X) \\neq p_{\\text{obs}}(y)\\]\nGoal: Transform model outputs to match observational distribution characteristics.\n\n\n9.3.4 Example: Bias Correction\nSimplest distributional method corrects the mean:\n\\[\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{bias} &= \\mathbb{E}[X] - \\mathbb{E}[y] \\\\\n\\hat{y} &= X - \\text{bias}\n\\end{aligned}\\]\nQuestion: Is this distributional or supervised? Answer: Distributional - uses distributional moments, not paired data.\n\n\n9.3.5 Example: Quantile-Quantile Mapping\nMore sophisticated approach matching full distributions:\n\nCalculate quantiles: For probabilities \\(p \\in [0,1]\\):\n\nModel quantile: \\(q_m(p) = F_m^{-1}(p)\\)\nObserved quantile: \\(q_o(p) = F_o^{-1}(p)\\)\n\nCreate mapping function: \\(h(x) = F_o^{-1}(F_m(x))\\)\nApply correction: \\(\\hat{y} = h(X)\\)\n\nInterpretation: Transform model value to its quantile, then map to corresponding observed quantile.\nAdvantages: - Corrects entire distribution, not just mean - Preserves temporal correlations - Handles non-Gaussian distributions\nLimitations: - Assumes stationarity of correction - Cannot add variability not present in model - May create artifacts at distribution tails\n\n\n9.3.6 Example: CDF Matching\nAlternative approach directly matches cumulative distribution functions:\n\nEstimate CDFs: \\(\\hat{F}_m(x)\\) and \\(\\hat{F}_o(x)\\)\nDefine mapping: Minimize \\(\\int |\\hat{F}_m(h(x)) - \\hat{F}_o(x)| dx\\)\nApply transformation: Use optimal \\(h(\\cdot)\\) to correct future data\n\nThis is closely related to quantile mapping but may use different estimation techniques.",

    "text": "14.7 Mathematical framework for expected damages\n\n14.7.1 Expectation\nThe expected value of a function \\(f(x)\\) of a random variable \\(x\\) is: \\[\n\\mathbb{E}[f(x)] = \\int f(x) p(x) dx\n\\] where \\(p(x)\\) is the probability density function of \\(x\\).\nIn other words, for each possible value of \\(x\\), calculate \\(f(x)\\). We then take a weighted average, where the weights are the probability of each value of \\(x\\).\n\n\n14.7.2 Key insight\nYou cannot get the expected value of a function by plugging the expected value of the random variable into the function. \\[\n\\mathbb{E}[f(x)] \\neq f(\\mathbb{E}[x])\n\\]\n\n\n14.7.3 Expected damages\nIf we want to calculate the expected damages then we can use this formula \\[\n\\mathbb{E}[f(x)] = \\int f(x) p(x) dx\n\\] by defining \\(x\\) to be the hazard (e.g., flood depth) and \\(f(x)\\) the damage function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe key assumption we need is that we know the probability density function \\(p(x)\\)!\n\n\n\n\n\n14.7.4 Monte Carlo approximation\nIn general, \\(\\int f(x) p(x) dx\\) is hard to compute analytically. We can use Monte Carlo methods to approximate this integral.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMonte Carlo methods are a wide class of computational algorithms for approximating integrals.\n\n\n\n\n\n14.7.5 Monte Carlo expectation\nIf we draw \\(N\\) samples independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.) from a probability distribution \\(p(x)\\), denoted as \\(\\left\\{x_i\\right\\}_{i=1}^N\\) where \\(x_i \\sim p(x)\\), then \\[\n\\mathbb{E}[f(x)] \\approx \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^N f(x_i)\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDrawing \\(N\\) samples iid from \\(p(x)\\) can be inefficient. Most of the samples will be in regions where \\(f(x)\\) is small, so we are wasting computational effort. There are many clever ways around this.\n\n\n\n\n\n14.7.6 For example: Trapezoidal EAD\nRunning regional flood models is computationally expensive. Often, a model may have been run for a few different nominal return levels. For example, we might have flood depths at each grid for the nominal 10, 25, 50, 100, 250, and 500 year floods.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 14.7: de Moel, van Vliet, and Aerts (2014) uses trapezoidal methods to approximate the expected annual damages.",

    "text": "15.1 Motivation\nWe often want a quantitative way to compare two or more decisions. Hence, cost-benefit analysis.\nIt’s a simple idea. For a given “decision” (being deliberately vague about what we mean by this), we need some function that tells us how good or bad the decision is. Then, we can compare the goodness of different decisions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a motivating example, consider that we are have been asked to help a homeowner decide whether to elevate their home by 5ft to protect against future flooding, or whether to leave it as-is.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 15.1: Floodproofing in Houston, TX (Houston Public Media)",

    "text": "15.2 Quantifying costs and benefits\nWe want to pick the decision that maximizes the “goodness” of the decision. We’ll call this a “utility” function, but could also use “objective function”, “loss function”, “damage function”, etc. Let’s give this some formal notation: \\[\nu(a, \\mathbf{s}): \\mathcal{A} \\times \\mathcal{S} \\to \\mathbb{R}\n\\] where \\(u\\) is the utility function, \\(a \\in \\mathcal{A}\\) is the decision, and \\(\\mathbf{s} \\in \\mathcal{S}\\) is the state of the world.\n\nWe’ll use “state of the world” as a deliberately vague term that we will use to describe all the uncertainties we want to think about when making a decision.\nYou can remember that \\(a\\) is the decision because it’s the first letter of “action”.\n\nOften, utility is measured in money. This is not because money is the only thing that matters, but because it is a common unit of account that allows us to compare different things. However, utility can be measured in other units as well – it only requires that we put all the costs and benefits into a common unit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn our house elevation example, we might consider the following costs and benefits: up-front cost of elevating; cost of flood insurance; change in property value; and cost of damages not covered by flood insurance. These might be well-described in monetary terms. However, putting a value on the peace of mind from not having to worry about future flooding, or the reduced risk of death, is trickier.",

The idea is to discount future costs and benefits to the present day.

    "text": "16.4 Multiobjective Policy Search and Optimization\n\n16.4.1 Enriching our notation\nWhen we move from single to multiple objectives, our system dynamics notation becomes more complex: - We may have multiple outcome functions rather than a single scalar outcome\n\n\n16.4.2 Single-objective policy search\nUsing this notation, we want to \\(\\min / \\max g(a)\\), subject to constraints.\nIn other words, we want a single solution that scores the best according to \\(g(a)\\).\n\n\n16.4.3 Objectives can be hard to combine\nSometimes, combining objectives into a single function is difficult.\n\nOperating a reservoir to maximize power generation, minimize flood risk, and supply water to a city.\nDesigning a levee to balance cost, financial flood risk, ecological impact, and human safety.\n\nAddressing multiple, sometimes-competing, needs is often called “multi-criteria decision analysis”\n\n\n16.4.4 Goals\nGoal: find a set of solutions that are not dominated by any other solution\nWe call this the Pareto front or Pareto set.\n\n\n16.4.5 Mathematical formulation\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n& \\min / \\max f_m(x), & \\quad m = 1, 2, \\ldots, M \\\\\n\\text{subject to} \\quad &g_j(x) \\leq 0, &\\quad  j = 1, 2, \\ldots, J \\\\\n&h_k(x) = 0, &\\quad  k = 1, 2, \\ldots, K \\\\\n&x_i^{(L)} \\leq x_i \\leq x_i^{(U)}, &\\quad  i = 1, 2, \\ldots, N\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nWhat’s new? - \\(M\\) objective functions - Lots of notation for constraints\n\n\n16.4.6 Dominance\nConcept of Dominance: 1. Single-objective: Goodness of solution defined by objective function value 2. Multi-objective: Goodness of solution defined by dominance relationships\nDefinition: Solution \\(a_1\\) dominates solution \\(a_2\\) if: 1. \\(a_1\\) is no worse than \\(a_2\\) in all objectives 2. \\(a_1\\) is strictly better than \\(a_2\\) in at least one objective\nExample Analysis: Consider 5 solutions with objectives \\(f_1\\) (maximize) and \\(f_2\\) (minimize): - Solution 1: \\((2, 2)\\) - Solution 2: \\((1, 4)\\) - Solution 3: \\((4, 1)\\) - Solution 4: \\((3, 3)\\) - Solution 5: \\((5, 2)\\)\nDominance relationships: - Solution 1 vs 2: Solution 1 dominates (better in \\(f_1\\): 2&gt;1, better in \\(f_2\\): 2&lt;4) - Solution 1 vs 5: Solution 5 dominates (better in \\(f_1\\): 5&gt;2, same in \\(f_2\\): 2=2) - Solution 1 vs 4: Neither dominates (trade-offs exist)\nSolutions that are not dominated by any other feasible solution form the Pareto front.\n\n\n16.4.7 Goals of multiobjective optimization\n\nFind solutions as close to Pareto front as possible\nFind solutions as diverse as possible (since infinite points lie along the Pareto front but we can only sample a finite number)\n\n\n\n16.4.8 Implementation Approaches\n\n\n16.4.9 Weighted Sum Method\nWe can scalarize the multi-objective problem into a single-objective problem using a weighted sum:\n\\[\n\\min F(x) =\\sum_{m=1}^M w_m f_m(x)\n\\] subject to the same constraints as before.\nAdvantages: - Simplicity: Easy to understand and implement - Computational efficiency: Can use existing single-objective optimization algorithms - Pareto front exploration: Can vary weights systematically to explore trade-offs\nDisadvantages: - Weight selection: Requires a priori knowledge of preferences - Pareto front coverage: May miss parts of the Pareto front, especially in non-convex regions - Uniform weight distribution: Does not guarantee uniform distribution of solutions along Pareto front\nConvex vs. Non-Convex Pareto Fronts:\nFor convex Pareto fronts, the weighted sum method can find any point on the front by varying weights.\nFor non-convex Pareto fronts, the weighted sum method cannot find solutions in concave regions - certain trade-offs are mathematically unreachable regardless of weight selection.\nThis limitation motivates the need for population-based methods like genetic algorithms.\n\n\n16.4.10 Genetic Algorithms for Multi-Objective Optimization\nEvolutionary Approach: Genetic algorithms are particularly well-suited for multi-objective optimization because they work with populations of solutions rather than single points.\nCore Principles: 1. Population-based: GAs operate on a set (“population” or “generation”) of candidate solutions 2. Evolutionary inspiration: The best solutions are more likely to survive and reproduce 3. Fitness evaluation: Compute a fitness score for each solution based on objectives and diversity 4. Selection and reproduction: Use fitness scores to select solutions for reproduction (crossover) 5. Mutation: Add controlled noise (mutation) to create the next “generation” 6. Algorithmic variety: Many specific algorithms exist (NSGA-II, SPEA2, etc.)\nMulti-Objective Fitness: Unlike single-objective GAs, multi-objective versions must balance: - Convergence: Solutions should be close to the true Pareto front - Diversity: Solutions should be well-distributed along the Pareto front\nSelection Mechanisms: - Non-dominated sorting: Rank solutions by dominance levels - Crowding distance: Maintain diversity by favoring solutions in less crowded regions - Archive maintenance: Preserve best non-dominated solutions across generations\nAdvantages: - Global search: Can handle complex, multimodal objective spaces - Non-convex fronts: Can find solutions in concave regions of Pareto fronts - No weight specification: Does not require a priori preference information - Population diversity: Naturally maintains diverse set of trade-off solutions\nDisadvantages: - Computational cost: Requires many function evaluations - Parameter tuning: Multiple algorithm parameters need careful adjustment - Stochastic nature: Results may vary between runs - Convergence uncertainty: Difficult to guarantee global optimality\n\n\n16.4.11 A Population of Trade-off Solutions\nFinal Output: Multi-objective optimization produces a set of solutions rather than a single optimal solution.\nCharacteristics: 1. Non-dominated solutions: A set of solutions where no solution dominates any other 2. Trade-off representation: Each solution represents a different trade-off between objectives\n3. Pareto front coverage: Solutions collectively approximate different parts of the Pareto front\nInterpretation and Value: One key insight of multi-objective optimization is that it maps out the trade-offs between competing objectives.\nThis is valuable because: - Decision support: Shows range of feasible trade-offs to decision-makers - Trade-off quantification: Makes explicit the costs of improving one objective at expense of others - Robust analysis: Multiple good solutions provide options under different preference structures - Stakeholder engagement: Different solutions may appeal to different stakeholders or constituencies\nExample Applications: - Reservoir operation: Trade-offs between flood protection, water supply, and hydropower generation - Urban planning: Balance between development density, green space, and transportation access - Climate policy: Trade-offs between mitigation costs, emission reductions, and economic impacts\n\n\n16.4.12 Convergence Assessment and Quality Control\nChallenge of Heuristic Methods: Genetic algorithms are not exact optimization methods. They rely on heuristics to decide when a solution is “good enough” even if it’s not a global optimum. This creates challenges for assessing solution quality and algorithm convergence.\nQuality Assessment Strategies:\n1. Multiple Runs with Different Seeds: - Repeat optimization with different random initial conditions - Compare results across runs to assess robustness - If results vary significantly, may need longer runs or parameter adjustment\n2. Hypervolume Indicator: - Definition: Volume of objective space dominated by the solution set - Purpose: Measures both convergence (proximity to true front) and diversity (spread along front)\n- Application: Track hypervolume over generations to assess convergence - Advantages: Single metric combining multiple quality aspects\n3. Method Comparison: - Compare genetic algorithm results to weighted sum method - Check if GA finds solutions in regions missed by weighted sum (especially non-convex areas) - Cross-validate using different algorithmic approaches (NSGA-II, SPEA2, etc.)\n4. Benchmark Comparison: - Compare optimization results to human-generated or expert solutions - Verify that algorithm finds solutions that dominate known alternatives - Use analytical solutions for simplified test problems to validate implementation\n5. Convergence Monitoring: - Track solution set changes over generations - Monitor when new non-dominated solutions stop being found - Use metrics like generational distance and inverted generational distance\nPractical Implementation Guidelines: - Run length: Balance computational cost with solution quality - Population size: Larger populations provide better diversity but increase cost - Multiple objectives: More objectives exponentially increase difficulty - Archive management: Maintain external archive of best solutions found\n\n\n16.4.13 The challenge of Many Objectives\nDiminishing Returns from Additional Objectives:\nWhile it may seem beneficial to include all relevant objectives explicitly, there are significant drawbacks to adding more objectives:\nComputational Challenges: - Exponential scaling: The number of solutions needed grows exponentially with objectives - Pareto front explosion: In high dimensions, most solutions become non-dominated - Search difficulty: Algorithms struggle to maintain diversity across many objectives\nCognitive and Communication Challenges:\n- Conceptual complexity: Humans cannot easily visualize or understand trade-offs among many objectives - Decision paralysis: Too many options can make decision-making more difficult - Communication barriers: Difficult to present and discuss results with stakeholders\nThe “Curse of Dimensionality” in Objective Space: As the number of objectives increases, the volume of the Pareto front grows exponentially relative to the volume of the entire objective space. This makes it increasingly difficult to find truly inferior solutions, reducing the effectiveness of dominance-based selection.\nPractical Guidelines:\nObjective Consolidation: - Combine related objectives into composite indices when appropriate - Use weighted sums for objectives that can be meaningfully combined - Focus on the most critical and independent objectives\nObjective Hierarchy: - Distinguish between primary objectives (core concerns) and secondary objectives (constraints or preferences) - Consider using some objectives as constraints rather than explicit objectives - Implement lexicographic ordering for objectives with clear priority structure\nRule of Thumb: - 2-3 objectives: Manageable and interpretable - 4-6 objectives: Possible but requires careful analysis - &gt;6 objectives: Generally not recommended without specialized techniques\nWhen Many Objectives Are Necessary: - Use techniques like objective reduction or dimensionality reduction in objective space - Consider interactive optimization where decision-maker preferences guide the search - Apply many-objective evolutionary algorithms (e.g., NSGA-III) specifically designed for high-dimensional objective spaces\nConclusion: The goal is to find the minimum number of objectives that adequately capture the essential trade-offs in the decision problem. Quality over quantity applies strongly in multi-objective optimization.",

Risk-based and risk-averse approaches can still be used (e.g., examining 95th percentile of damages, weighting bad outcomes more heavily).\nFor deep uncertainty, alternative approaches include: - Exploratory modeling: No assumptions of likelihood made - Robustness approaches: Aggregate metrics across scenarios, though this is implicitly similar to assuming a probability distribution",

    "section": "18.8 Philosophical Approaches to Deep Uncertainty",
    "text": "18.8 Philosophical Approaches to Deep Uncertainty\n\n18.8.1 The Lempert-Schneider Debate\nA fundamental tension in climate policy involves whether and how to assign probabilities to deeply uncertain scenarios. This debate is well illustrated by contrasting views from Robert Lempert and Stephen Schneider regarding IPCC scenarios.\n\n18.8.1.1 The Case Against Probabilities (Lempert’s Position)\nTraditional prediction-based approaches are inadequate: The conventional framework for climate policy relies on predicting the future and identifying optimal policies. However, such predictions are inherently unreliable for complex, long-term issues like climate change.\nOptimal policies based on point estimates are brittle: Policies optimized for specific future scenarios fail when different futures unfold. Moreover, they fail to generate consensus among stakeholders with divergent expectations about the future.\nRobust strategies are preferable to optimal ones: Rather than seeking optimal policies, we should identify robust strategies that perform reasonably well across a wide range of plausible futures. Robust strategies are less sensitive to uncertainty and more likely to garner stakeholder support.\nExploratory modeling enables robust decision-making: Computer simulations can create large ensembles of plausible scenarios based on different assumptions. Analysts can systematically explore strategy performance across scenarios, identifying those that work well under various conditions.\n\n\n18.8.1.2 The Case for Probabilities (Schneider’s Position)\nRisk requires both probability and consequence: The concept of risk inherently combines the probability of events with their consequences. Without probabilities, decision-makers are left with only consequences, potentially leading to misplaced priorities.\nIPCC’s failure to assign probabilities creates confusion: Presenting scenarios without indicating relative likelihood allows cherry-picking of results to support preferred narratives. Low-probability, high-consequence outcomes may receive undue emphasis, distorting public debate.\nExpert judgment provides valuable information: While subjective and uncertain, probabilistic assessments can provide valuable guidance when done transparently. These should be attempted for each step of the climate modeling chain—emissions scenarios, carbon cycle modeling, climate sensitivity, and impacts.\nProbability assumptions matter enormously: Different assumptions about scenario likelihoods can lead to vastly different risk assessments. For example, the probability of exceeding “dangerous” warming thresholds can range from 25% to nearly 40% depending on probability assignments.\n\n\n18.8.1.3 Synthesis\nBoth perspectives offer important insights: - Lempert highlights the dangers of false precision in probability estimates - Schneider emphasizes the need for risk-based thinking in policy contexts\nIn practice, many successful approaches combine elements of both perspectives, using scenario analysis to explore robustness while acknowledging that some scenarios are more plausible than others.",

    "text": "20.1 Adaptive management frameworks\n\n20.1.1 Real options and flexibility\nThe financial theory of real options defines “the right, but not obligation” to take a particular action in the future. For example, purchasing the right to buy stocks at a fixed price gives flexibility to exercise the option only if favorable conditions emerge.\nThis concept has motivated applications in engineering and policy design. Creating flexibility in decision making can be very valuable, though generating naturally flexible designs isn’t always straightforward.\nA classic example in infrastructure: when building a parking garage, should we: - Build to a few floors immediately? - Build to many floors immediately? - Build a few floors but with extra-strong foundations so we can add levels later if demand increases?\nThe third option provides valuable flexibility—it creates the option to expand without the full upfront cost. In climate adaptation, similar principles apply: - Design infrastructure that can be upgraded rather than replaced - Implement monitoring systems that can trigger additional interventions - Create institutional frameworks that can accommodate evolving policies\n\n\n20.1.2 Policy parameterization\nIn climate adaptation contexts, there are many ways to parameterize adaptive policies. Common approaches include:\nThreshold-based rules: Define triggers (e.g., sea level rise exceeding X cm, temperature increases beyond Y°C) that activate specific interventions.\nBuffer-based approaches: Maintain safety margins that shrink over time, triggering adaptation when margins become inadequate.\nPathway-based strategies: Pre-define sequences of interventions, with decision points based on observed conditions and new information.\nMore complex adaptive policies can use machine learning approaches, though these require careful consideration of interpretability and stakeholder acceptance.",

    "section": "20.2 Dynamic decision-making under uncertainty",
    "text": "20.2 Dynamic decision-making under uncertainty\nDynamic planning problems identify policies to select actions in response to new information over time. Policy design involves choosing the sequence, timing, and/or threshold of actions to achieve a desired outcome. This typically involves a combination of optimal control and adaptive design.\nUnlike static decision problems where all decisions are made upfront, sequential decisions allow us to wait and incorporate new information. For example, rather than deciding today how high to elevate a house, we could wait to see how fast local sea-levels are rising, then make a decision later with more information.\n\n20.2.1 Sequential decision framework\nIn sequential decision problems, the decision maker does not need to make all decisions at once. Instead, at each time step, the decision maker makes a decision based on the state of the system (which may not be fully observable). In climate risk management, the state might include current exposure levels, recent climate observations, and evolving socio-economic conditions.\nMathematically, the state evolves over time according to a dynamics model: \\[\n\\mathbf{x}_{t+1} = f_t(\\mathbf{x}_t, a_t, e_{t+1}),\n\\] where\n\n\\(\\mathbf{x}_t\\) is the state at time \\(t\\)\n\\(a_t\\) is the decision at time \\(t\\) (e.g., whether to implement an adaptation measure)\n\\(e_{t+1}\\) is external forcing (e.g., climate change, socio-economic development)\n\n\\(f_t\\) describes how the system evolves in response to actions and external factors\n\n\n\n20.2.2 Policy and value\nThe decision maker’s strategy for choosing actions is called a policy. The policy is a function that maps states to actions, and can be either deterministic or stochastic.\nA central idea is to maximize the expected sum of future rewards (or minimize expected costs). Actions that give low rewards now might lead to high rewards in the future. For example, spending money on early adaptation might reduce future climate damages.\nThe value of a state is the expected sum of future rewards that can be obtained from that state, assuming the decision maker follows a particular policy.\n\n\n20.2.3 Solution approaches\nOpen loop control solves for all actions at once, producing a predetermined schedule of interventions. The advantage is simplicity of execution. The disadvantage is inflexibility—it doesn’t adapt to new information.\nDynamic programming uses the recursive Bellman equation to find optimal policies: \\[\nQ_t(\\mathbf{x}_t) = \\min_{a_t} \\left\\{ R_t + \\gamma Q_{t+1} (\\mathbf{x}_{t+1}) \\right\\}\n\\] where \\(\\gamma\\) is the discount factor and \\(Q_t\\) is the value function.\nThis approach can provide exact solutions but requires discretizing the problem and suffers from the “curse of dimensionality” as the number of states and actions grows.\nPolicy search assumes a specific functional form for the policy with parameters to optimize. Common approaches include linear decision rules, decision trees, and neural networks. This approach is flexible and works well with simulation-optimization frameworks, but can be computationally expensive.",

As defined by Bullard (1999):\n\nEnvironmental racism refers to any environmental policy, practice or directive that differentially affects or disadvantages (whether intended or unintended) individuals, groups or communities based on race or colour.\n\nThis definition importantly focuses on effects rather than intent, recognizing that policies can create disparate impacts regardless of intention.\n\n21.2.3.1 Five Dimensions of Justice\nFollowing Wutich et al. (2023), environmental justice encompasses multiple dimensions:\n\nDistributive Justice: Fair and equitable access to resources and outcomes across social groups\n\nExample: No disparities in flood protection measures between low-income and high-income neighborhoods\n\nInterpersonal Justice: Fair and equitable treatment of individuals regardless of identity\n\nExample: Equal consideration for post-flood assistance regardless of income level\n\nProcedural Justice: Fair and equitable rules, norms, and decision-making processes\n\nExample: Equal opportunities for community participation in flood risk management decisions\n\nRecognition Justice: Fair and equitable representation of different worldviews and values\n\nExample: Including Indigenous knowledge in flood risk management strategies\n\nTransformative (Restorative) Justice: Collaborative addressing of root causes of systemic oppression\n\nExample: Targeted investments to address historical inequities in flood risk exposure\n\n\n\n\n21.2.3.2 Quantitative Frameworks for Equity Assessment\nDifferent moral frameworks provide different approaches to quantifying equity (Jafino et al., 2022):\nUtilitarian: Maximize aggregate welfare - Maximize: \\(\\sum_{i=1}^n u(x_i)\\)\nStrict Egalitarian: Minimize inequality of outcomes - Minimize: \\(\\max(u(x_i)) - \\min(u(x_i))\\)\nRawlsian Difference Principle: Benefit the least advantaged - Maximize: \\(\\min(u(x_i))\\)\nPrioritarian: Weight welfare of worse-off individuals more heavily - Maximize: \\(\\frac{1}{1-\\gamma} \\sum_{i=1}^n u(\\frac{u(x_i)}{u(\\bar{x})})^{1-\\gamma}\\) where \\(\\gamma\\) is the inequality aversion factor\nSufficientarian: Ensure all individuals meet minimum welfare thresholds - Maximize: \\(\\{i \\in n : u(x_i) \\geq u(s)\\}\\) where \\(u(s)\\) is the minimum sufficient welfare level\nNote that quantifying welfare functions is notoriously challenging, involving fundamental questions about value comparison and measurement.\n\n\n\n21.2.4 Practical Considerations for Equity Assessment\n\n21.2.4.1 Equity in What?\nEnvironmental justice analysis should examine both burdens and benefits: - Risk: Distribution of potential consequences across groups - Funding: Allocation of resources for risk management and recovery - Recovery: Different groups’ ability to recover from climate impacts - Benefits: Distribution of positive outcomes like reduced risk or improved quality of life\n\n\n21.2.4.2 Equity at What Scale?\nThe choice of spatial aggregation significantly impacts equity assessments: - Individual level: Household or building-level outcomes - Neighborhood level: Community-defined boundaries important for environmental justice - Small areas: Administrative boundaries like census tracts - Large areas: Cities or regions\nDifferent scales can reveal or obscure disparities, so the choice should reflect where inequities are produced and experienced.\n\n\n21.2.4.3 Equity with Respect to What?\nEquity can be assessed across multiple dimensions: - Demographics: Income, race, ethnicity, age, or composite vulnerability indices - Environmental burden: Exposure to pollution, access to environmental amenities - Procedural factors: Historical discrimination, differential policy treatment - Causal factors: Root causes that produce inequities rather than just describing disparities\n\n\n\n21.2.5 Distributional Analysis\nTools for analyzing how climate risks and policies affect different groups:\n\nIncidence analysis: Who bears costs and receives benefits?\nVulnerability mapping: Which groups face highest risks?\nEquity weighting: How to adjust welfare measures for distributional concerns?\nEnvironmental justice screening: Identifying cumulative impacts on disadvantaged communities",

    "text": "A.2 Dig deeper\n\nA.2.1 Julia\nJulia is a fast, modern programming language designed for scientific computing. Its syntax closely mirrors mathematical notation, making it intuitive for researchers while delivering performance comparable to C and Fortran.\nJuliaUp is the official Julia version manager. It simplifies installation, allows you to maintain multiple Julia versions simultaneously, and keeps your installation current with the latest releases. This is especially useful as the Julia ecosystem evolves rapidly.\nSee the Julia page for more.\n\n\nA.2.2 Quarto\nQuarto is a scientific publishing system that enables you to combine code, results, and narrative text in reproducible documents. Think of it as the next generation of R Markdown, but with multi-language support (Julia, Python, R, and more).\nThis textbook is written in Quarto. Unlike traditional notebooks, Quarto documents are plain text files that render to multiple output formats (HTML, PDF, Word, presentations) while maintaining computational reproducibility.\nYou can learn more at:\n\nOfficial Tutorial: Hello, Quarto - basic document creation\nOfficial Tutorial: Computations - integrating code\nComprehensive Quarto documentation\n\n\nA.2.2.1 Writing with Markdown and math\nQuarto uses Markdown syntax with LaTeX math notation. Essential references:\n\nMarkdown Cheatsheet - basic text formatting\nLaTeX Cheatsheet - mathematical notation\nMathpix Snip - convert equation images to LaTeX code (free tier available)\nDetexify - draw symbols to find LaTeX commands\n\n\n\n\nA.2.3 Visual Studio Code\nVisual Studio Code is a free, open-source code editor developed by Microsoft. Its strength lies in its extensibility—thousands of extensions add language support, debugging capabilities, and productivity tools.\nFor our workflow, the Julia extension transforms VS Code into a full Julia development environment with syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion, integrated debugging, and a built-in REPL. The Quarto extension provides similar capabilities for computational documents, including live preview and cell execution.\nYou can learn more at the official tutorial.\n\n\nA.2.4 Git and GitHub\nGit is a distributed version control system that tracks changes in your code over time. GitHub is a cloud-based platform that hosts Git repositories and adds collaboration features like issue tracking, pull requests, and project management.\nVersion control is essential for reproducible research—it allows you to track changes, collaborate with others, recover from mistakes, and share your work publicly. This textbook itself is maintained on GitHub.\nYou can learn more at:\n\nGit and GitHub for Poets - beginner-friendly video series\nGitHub Hello World – official docs\nVersion Control - comprehensive guide from MIT’s “Missing Semester”",

Beyond web-based chatbots, you may have useed tools like GitHub Copilot (free for students and educators) or Claude Code (see free Deeplearning.AI Course). LLMs use powerful new technologies that can support learning and replace tedious tasks, but they can also threaten your intellectual growth and skill development (Kosmyna et al. 2025; Bastani et al. 2025).\nIt is clear that there are some tasks that should be delegated to these models and some tasks that must remain human-driven.
