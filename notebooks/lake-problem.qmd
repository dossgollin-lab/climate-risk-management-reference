# Dynamic Policy Search: The Lake Problem {.unnumbered}

We're building on the lake problem as described in @quinn_dps:2017.

The lake problem involves a hypothetical town on a lake that faces a pollution control problem.
The town wants to maximize its economic benefits by discharging phosphorus (P) into the lake.
However, excessive P can cause the lake to cross a critical threshold and become irreversibly eutrophic (polluted).
