# Dynamic Policy Search: The Lake Problem üìù {.unnumbered}

## Learning Objectives {.unnumbered}

- Apply dynamic policy search to optimal lake management
- Understand how threshold models create path dependence
- Compare different policy structures and their performance
- Analyze tradeoffs between economic benefits and environmental protection

We're building on the lake problem as described in @quinn_dps:2017.

The lake problem involves a hypothetical town on a lake that faces a pollution control problem.
The town wants to maximize its economic benefits by discharging phosphorus (P) into the lake.
However, excessive P can cause the lake to cross a critical threshold and become irreversibly eutrophic (polluted).
