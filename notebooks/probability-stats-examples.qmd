This notebook provides computational examples to accompany the [Probability and inference](../chapters/fundamentals/probability-stats.qmd) chapter.

## Examples to be added

### Monte Carlo basics and asymptotic theory
- Monte Carlo simulation of coin flips (demonstrating Law of Large Numbers)
- Central Limit Theorem visualization with simulation
- Monte Carlo integration examples

### Coin flip example
- Analytical maximum likelihood estimation
- Bootstrap confidence intervals for coin flip parameter
- Bayesian inference with conjugate Beta-Binomial model
- MCMC sampling for coin flip (comparison with analytical solution)

### Linear regression example  
- Ordinary least squares implementation
- Bootstrap confidence intervals for regression parameters
- Bayesian linear regression with conjugate normal priors
- MCMC sampling for Bayesian linear regression

### Logistic regression example
- Numerical maximum likelihood optimization
- Bootstrap confidence intervals for logistic regression
- MCMC sampling for Bayesian logistic regression
- MCMC diagnostics and convergence assessment

### Advanced topics
- Propagating parameter uncertainty to predictions
- Comparing frequentist and Bayesian uncertainty quantification
- When to use analytical vs. numerical vs. simulation methods
