We strive to acknowledge and communicate uncertainty without letting it paralyze our decision-making.\nAlthough we rely on quantitative tools to characterize uncertainty and guide risk strategies, we interpret those quantitative results through a qualitative lens.\nIn other words, we aim to build and deeply understand our models without taking them too literally.\n\nWhen translating theoretical concepts into real-world examples, one approach is to make significant idealizations that yield neat analytical solutions.\nHere, we opt instead for a **computational** perspective.\nAll code examples use the [Julia language](appendices/julia.qmd), but the core ideas apply broadly--Python is widely used in climate data science and R is especially popular in statistics.\n\n## Structure\n\nThis textbook began as online lecture notes for two courses at Rice University: **CEVE 543 (Data Science Methods for Climate Hazard Assessment)** and **CEVE 421 (Climate Risk Management)**.\nAlthough these courses informed one another, they focused on distinct techniques in climate risk assessment and management--an approach reflected in the structure of this book.\nBy separating the textbook from the class, we hope to create an open-source community resource for **Climate Risk Management**.\n\nThis text is designed to be used as a reference, rather than to be covered from start to finish in a single course.\nIt is organized as follows:\n\n- **Part 1** provides a foundational toolkit in probability, inference, Bayesian methods, optimization, and essential climate science knowledge.  \n- **Part 2** explores the mechanics of modeling climate hazards and extremes, showing how to build and refine catastrophe models and handle complex climate data.  \n- **Part 3** moves into decision-making, policy, and equity concerns of climate risk, helping you connect technical insights to real-world management and policy solutions.\n\n## Pre-requisites\n\nA background in **statistics** and/or **machine learning** is helpful.\nWe also assume some familiarity with **programming**, which you can develop (or refresh) through resources listed in the [Julia appendix](appendices/julia.qmd).\n\n## Contributing\n\nThis textbook is a work in progress, and we welcome your contributions.\nWhether it’s fixing a typo or proposing a new module, every suggestion helps.\nThe easiest way to contribute is to fork the repository and submit a pull request.\nIf you’re not comfortable with that workflow, please open an issue [on GitHub]({{< book.github >}}).\n\nThis textbook is and will always remain free, licensed under the [CC BY-SA 4.0 License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).\n\n## Related Projects\n\n- **@abernathey_datascience:2024** is an excellent resource covering introductory topics in Earth and climate data science using Python, with an emphasis on foundational computations. It serves as a great prerequisite for more advanced material in this book.\n\n## Cite\n\nPlease cite this book as:\n\n```bibtex\n@book{doss-gollin_climate_2024,\n  author = {Doss-Gollin, James},\n
