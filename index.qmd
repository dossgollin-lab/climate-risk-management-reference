# Preface {.unnumbered}

Welcome to the online textbook **Climate Risk Assessment and Management**, which aims to provide a comprehensive introduction to the field of climate risk management.
Our goal is to address the needs of decision-makers while acknowledging the limitations of the data and models used to study climate phenomena.

Information on the probabilities of extreme events plays a key role in many contexts, from designing infrastructure to shaping public policy.
However, by definition, these events are rare, meaning few observations exist to objectively estimate their probabilities—this is the challenge of {{< glossary "sampling error" >}}.
While we can try to compensate for limited observations by using models to simulate various weather scenarios and their effects on extreme events, these models inevitably have {{< glossary "biases" >}} that limit their reliability.
Balancing sparse observations and imperfect models is a central theme in climate risk management. We strive to acknowledge and communicate uncertainty without letting it paralyze our decision-making.
Although we rely on quantitative tools to characterize uncertainty and guide risk strategies, we interpret those quantitative results through a qualitative lens.
In other words, we aim to build and deeply understand our models without taking them too literally.

When translating theoretical concepts into real-world examples, one approach is to make significant idealizations that yield neat analytical solutions.
Here, we opt instead for a computational perspective.
All code examples use the [Julia language](appendices/julia.qmd), but the core ideas apply broadly--Python is widely used in climate data science and R is especially popular in statistics.

## Structure

This textbook began as online lecture notes for two courses at Rice University: **CEVE 543 (Data Science Methods for Climate Hazard Assessment)** and **CEVE 421 (Climate Risk Management)**.
Although these courses informed one another, they focused on distinct techniques in climate risk assessment and management--an approach reflected in the structure of this book.
By separating the textbook from the class, we hope to create an open-source community resource for **Climate Risk Management**.

This text is designed to be used as a reference, rather than to be covered from start to finish in a single course.
It is organized as follows:

- **Part 1** provides a foundational toolkit in probability, inference, Bayesian methods, optimization, and essential climate science knowledge.  
- **Part 2** explores the mechanics of modeling climate hazards and extremes, showing how to build and refine catastrophe models and handle complex climate data.  
- **Part 3** moves into decision-making, policy, and equity concerns of climate risk, helping you connect technical insights to real-world management and policy solutions.

## Pre-requisites

A background in **statistics** and/or **machine learning** is helpful.
We also assume some familiarity with **programming**, which you can develop (or refresh) through resources listed in the [Julia appendix](appendices/julia.qmd).
