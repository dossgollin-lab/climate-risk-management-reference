## Under Construction

This collection of lecture notes (the word "textbook" implies a level of completeness and polish that we are not particularly near) is under active development.
Currently (Fall 2025), content is being added for use in my fall course at Rice University.
Please check back frequently for updates, and feel free to [open an issue on GitHub]({{< book.github >}}) if you have questions or suggestions!

Understanding the probabilities of extreme events is crucial in many contexts, from designing infrastructure to pricing insurance and shaping public policy.
This book provides a comprehensive introduction to hydroclimate risk management, focusing on the statistical and computational methods used to assess and manage risks associated with extreme weather events and climate change.
It is designed to be accessible and relevant to engineers, catastrophe modelers, and applied scientists, offering a solid foundation in the principles and practices of hydroclimate risk management.

## Structure

This text is modular and organized as follows:

- **Part 1** introduces key topics in probability, inference, Bayesian methods, optimization, machine learning, and Earth science. Rather than providing a comprehensive treatment, this part focuses on essential concepts and links to further references. It is best used as a reference to support the rest of the book, rather than as a standalone introduction to these topics.
- **Part 2** focuses on hazard **assessment**, namely modeling climate hazards and extremes. Material is organized around thematic applications and predictive tasks. The foundational idea is integrating information from noisy and/or biased sources to estimate the joint probability distribution of relevant hydroclimatic variables. Since all approaches are necessarily imperfect, clearly understanding and communicating the  assumptions underlying these estimates becomes essential.
- **Part 3** risk management, which involves both mapping hazard to risk and designing interventions to manage these risks. Key ideas include the sequential nature of decisions, the pursuit of unclear and/or contested objectives, and the need to account for the sensitivity of estimated probability distributions (of hazard and of other relevant physical, social, and economic variables) to underlying models and assumptions.
- This book is accompanied by a series of **computational notebooks** written in [Julia](https://julialang.org/), which illustrate and complement the methods and concepts discussed in the text. WHile notebooks are referenced in the text, they are designed as standalone and self-contained resources.

## Pre-requisites

Basic probability and multivariate calculus, along with linear algebra, are sufficient mathematical foundations for this textbook.
Some exposure to Earth science, hydrology, water resources, or related topics is strongly encouraged for context, though not strictly necessary for understanding methods.
This book builds on a wide range of topics and methods in statistics, machine learning, optimization, and Earth science, and expertise in any of these areas may deepen your understanding, but is not necessary.
No programming is required to read the book, but going through computational examples and applying methods to your own problems, which can substantially strengthen your understanding, does require programming.
The examples in this book use the Julia programming language; see the [Resources lis](/chapters/resources.qmd) for more.
