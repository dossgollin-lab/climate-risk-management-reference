# Preface {.unnumbered}

Welcome to the online textbook **Climate Risk Assessment and Management**, which aims to provide a comprehensive introduction to the field of climate risk management.

Information on the probabilities of extreme events plays a key role in many contexts, from designing infrastructure to shaping public policy.
This book focuses on supporting decisions about how to understand and manage the risks of extreme weather and hydrology at a range of spatial and temporal scales.
Its aim is to support adaptation.
While many of the tools and techniques are useful for problems like informing global climate mitigation policy or attribution and detection, those applications are beyond the core expertise here.

The fundamental challenge that we will grapple with is that high-impact extreme events are, by nature, rare, meaning few observations exist to objectively estimate their probabilities--this is the challenge of {{< glossary "sampling error" >}}.
While we can try to compensate for limited observations by using models to simulate various weather scenarios and their effects on extreme events, these models inevitably have {{< glossary "biases" >}} that limit their reliability.
Balancing sparse observations and imperfect models is a central theme in climate risk assessment (Part 2).

The uncertainty in these estimates motivates the need for a decision-making framework that can incorporate uncertainty and help us make informed choices about how to manage climate risk (Part 3).

When translating theoretical concepts into real-world examples, one approach is to make significant idealizations that yield neat analytical solutions.
Here, we opt instead for a computational perspective.
All code examples use the [Julia language](appendices/julia.qmd), but the core ideas apply broadly.

## Structure

This textbook began as online lecture notes for two courses at Rice University: **CEVE 543 (Data Science Methods for Climate Hazard Assessment)** and **CEVE 421 (Climate Risk Management)**.
Although these courses informed one another, they focused on distinct techniques in climate risk assessment and management--an approach reflected in the structure of this book.
By separating the textbook from the class, we hope to create an open-source community resource for **Climate Risk Management**.

This text is designed to be used as a reference, rather than to be covered from start to finish in a single course.
It is organized as follows:

- **Part 1** provides a foundational toolkit in probability, inference, Bayesian methods, optimization, and essential Earth science knowledge. It could be used for a course of its own, as a prerequisite for the other parts, or as a reference material to use as needed.
- **Part 2** explores the mechanics of modeling climate hazards and extremes, organizing material around thematic applications and predictive tasks rather than on specific models or methods.  
- **Part 3** moves into decision-making and risk management, with a focus on decision-making under uncertainty.

## Pre-requisites

A background in **statistics** and/or **machine learning** is helpful.
We also assume some familiarity with **programming**, which you can develop (or refresh) through resources listed in the [Julia appendix](appendices/julia.qmd).
