Welcome to the online textbook **Hydroclimate Risk Assessment and Management**.

Understanding the probabilities of extreme events is crucial in many contexts, from designing infrastructure to pricing insurance and shaping public policy.
This book provides a comprehensive introduction to hydroclimate risk management, focusing on the statistical and computational methods used to assess and manage risks associated with extreme weather events and climate change.
It is designed to be accessible and relevant to engineers, catastrophe modelers, and applied scientists, offering a solid foundation in the principles and practices of hydroclimate risk management.

## Structure

This text is modular and organized as follows:

- **Part 1** introduces key topics in probability, inference, Bayesian methods, optimization, machine learning, and Earth science. Rather than providing a comprehensive treatment, this part focuses on essential concepts and links to further references. It is best used as a reference to support the rest of the book, rather than as a standalone introduction to these topics.
- **Part 2** focuses on hazard **assessment**, namely modeling climate hazards and extremes. Material is organized around thematic applications and predictive tasks. The foundational idea is integrating information from noisy and/or biased sources to estimate the joint probability distribution of relevant hydroclimatic variables. Since all approaches are necessarily imperfect, clearly understanding and communicating the  assumptions underlying these estimates becomes essential.
- **Part 3** risk management, which involves both mapping hazard to risk and designing interventions to manage these risks. Key ideas include the sequential nature of decisions, the pursuit of unclear and/or contested objectives, and the need to account for the sensitivity of estimated probability distributions (of hazard and of other relevant physical, social, and economic variables) to underlying models and assumptions.

## Pre-requisites

A background in **statistics** and/or **machine learning** is helpful.
We also assume some familiarity with **programming**, which you can develop (or refresh) through resources listed in the [Julia appendix](appendices/julia.qmd).
Although linear algebra and differential calculus are essential for understanding statistics, machine learning, Earth science, and optimization at a deep level, this book focuses on understanding the concepts and applications of these methods, and so a conceptual understanding of these topics is usually sufficient.

## Related Projects

This textbook draws from classes I have taught at Rice University, courses I have taken, and courses taught by my close colleagues.
In particular, this draws from Upmanu Lall's Environmental Data Analysis course at Columbia and Vivek Srikrishnan's Environmental Systems Analysis and Climate Risk Analysis classes at Cornell.

There is also overlap with several other textbooks, including:

- **@abernathey_datascience:2024** is an excellent resource covering introductory topics in Earth and climate data science using Python, with an emphasis on foundational computations. These core computational concepts serves as a recommended prerequisite for more advanced material in this book.
- **@pyrcz_textbook:2024** is a textbook focused on applied machine learning, with a particular focus on geostatistics. There's less focus on extremes, hydroclimate, and decision-making, but it provides very clear and interpretable explanations of many machine learning methods, including some that are not directly covered in this book.
- **@helsel_waterresources:2020** is a comprehensive introduction to water resources and hydrology, focusing on statistical methods for analyzing hydrologic data. Its methods are traditional, with less emphasis on machine learning or Bayesian methods and more attention to null hypothesis significance testing, but its case studies are well-worked and thoughtfully described.
- **@loucks_planning:2017** provides a broad and rigorous overview of simulation, optimization, and multi-objective planning for water resource systems. While not focused on climate extremes, it forms a core reference for decision modeling and infrastructure management under uncertainty. This book extends Loucks by incorporating hydroclimate hazard modeling and deep uncertainty.
- **@marchau_decisionmakingunderdeepuncertainty:2019** introduces robust and adaptive decision frameworks designed for uncertain or unknowable futures. It covers methods like Robust Decision Making, Dynamic Adaptive Planning, and Info-Gap Theory. While not specific to climate or water, it provides essential theory for Part 3 of this book, which applies these frameworks to hydroclimate risk and adaptation.

In addition, most of the chapters in the book summarize topics that are themselves the subject of numerous more focused texts, which are summarized in the references at the end of each chapter.
