## Quarto + Jupyter

This textbook is written using the Quarto language.
Quarto allows us to combine code, math, and code output in a single document.
Jupyter notebooks fulfill a similar functionality, although they are implemented very differently.
Both use Markdown syntax with LaTeX math notation.

- [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/)
- [LaTeX Cheatsheet](https://ctan.math.washington.edu/tex-archive/info/undergradmath/undergradmath.pdf)
- [Mathpix Snip](https://mathpix.com/snip) allows you to convert images of equations to LaTeX code (there is a free tier)
- [Detexify](https://detexify.kirelabs.org/classify.html) lets you draw a symbol and suggests the LaTeX code for the corresponding symbol 

## Git and GitHub

Git and GitHub are widely used to share, save, collaborate on, and disseminate code, including this book.
There are lots of great resources for learning Git and GitHub, including:

- [Git Basics](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-git-basics) from The Odin Project.
- [Learn Git Branching](https://learngitbranching.js.org/): An interactive, visual tutorial to how git works.
- [Version Control](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/2020/version-control/) from MIT's "CS: Your Missing Semester" course.
- [Git and GitHub for Poets](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6ZF9C0YMKuns9sLDzK6zoiV): YouTube playlist covering the basics of git and GitHub.
