# Overview

## Motivation and Real-World Context

- Examples of recent extreme events and their impacts.
- The growing need for robust climate risk assessment.

## Scales of Interest & Applications

- From local (infrastructure planning) to regional (floodplain management) to global (international policy).
- Different time horizons (immediate disaster response vs. long-term adaptation planning).

## Key Concepts & Frameworks

- Hazard, vulnerability, exposure, and risk.
- The modeling-to-decision pipeline: data →→ models →→ insights →→ policy.

## Roadmap

- Brief overview of Fundamentals (Part 1).
- “Task-Oriented” approach to Climate Hazards & Catastrophe Modeling (Part 2).
- Risk Management & Policy (Part 3) and how it ties everything together.
