## Bayesian Utility Theory

We will often be interested in making decisions despite not having perfect information.
In the simplest, most ideal world, Bayesian Decision Theory provides a coherent framework for making optimal decisions:
$$
\mathbb{E}[U(a)] = \int U(a, s) p(s) ds,
$$
where $U(a, s)$ is the utility of action $a$ given "state of the world" $s$, and $p(s)$ is the probability density function of the state.
The "best" action is the one that maximizes expected utility.
This clean starting point provides a jumping-off point for framing the challenges of this book.
Although much of this book is focused on the reasons why this idealized framework is not sufficient, this simplifed framework is useful for framing a key goal, which is that we are interested not in forecasting the future through a crystal ball, but rather in estimating the probability distribution of future states of the world.
Specifically, we are interested in the {{< glossary "joint probability distribution" >}} of relevant variables, which may include both physical (e.g., climate hazard) and socioeconomic (e.g., vulnerability) variables.

### Types of uncertainty

- Aleatory uncertainty: inherent variability in the system (ie, randomness)
- Epistemic uncertainty: uncertainty in our knowledge of the system, often useful to divide into
    - Parametric uncertainty (what we will use here)
    - Model structure uncertainty (treated qualitatively)

### History

- First conceived as a way to try to explain human behavior
    - Turns out not to be a great model -- people do not always behave rationally

### Utility

- Some function that we want to maximize
- Alternatively can be thought of as a cost function that we want to minimize
- $U(a, \theta)$
    - $a$ is the action we take
    - $\theta$ is the state of the world

### Expected Utility

$$
\mathbb{E} \left[ U(a, \theta) \right] = \int_{\theta \in \Theta} U(a, \theta) p(\theta) d\theta
$$

or in the discrete case

$$
\mathbb{E} \left[ U(a, \theta) \right] = \sum_{\theta \in \Theta} U(a, \theta) p(\theta)
$$
