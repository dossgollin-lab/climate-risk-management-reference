I am an assistant professor of civil and environmental engineering at Rice University.
My research focuses broadly on understanding and managing the risks of hydroclimate extremes, particularly urban flooding.
I teach CEVE 543 ("Statistical-Physical Methods for Hydroclimate Extremes and Catastrophes") and CEVE 421/521 ("Climate Risk Management").
