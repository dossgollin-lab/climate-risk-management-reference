## Learning Objectives {.unnumbered}

- Address deep uncertainty in climate decision-making.
- Use robust decision-making (RDM) methods to compare strategies across multiple futures.
- Balance robustness vs. optimality in selecting climate actions.

## Deep uncertainty and scenario exploration

## Robust decision-making (RDM), info-gap theory

## Stress testing policies under various climate, economic, and societal conditions

## Trade-offs between robust vs. “best-estimate” solutions
