## See First {.unnumbered}

This chapter builds on concepts from:
- [Deep Uncertainty and Model Structure](/chapters/risk/deep-uncertainty.qmd)
- [Optimization](/chapters/fundamentals/optimization.qmd)

## Learning Objectives {.unnumbered}

- Address deep uncertainty in climate decision-making.
- Use robust decision-making (RDM) methods to compare strategies across multiple futures.
- Balance robustness vs. optimality in selecting climate actions.
