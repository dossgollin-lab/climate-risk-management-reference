## Learning Objectives

- Define and conceptualize risk within the climate context (hazard, exposure, vulnerability)
- Understand basic risk terminology (risk = probability Ã— consequence)
- Identify how different stakeholders perceive and prioritize climate risks
- Recognize and analyze multi-hazard events (e.g., hurricane + storm surge + inland flooding)
- Understand how cascading failures in interconnected systems (power grids, supply chains) amplify risk
- Apply systems thinking approaches to complex risk interactions

The most important concept is:
$$
\mathbb{E}\left[ f(x) \right] \neq f \left( \mathbb{E}[x] \right)
$$
where $x$ is some random variable and $f$ is some function.
In our context, this means that if we want to know the expected value of a risk-related variable, like damage, we should not just take the expected value of the hazard and then apply a damage function to that.
Extending the concept further, the damage caused by a hazard that scores in the 99th percentile of a chosen intensity measure may not be the 99th percentile of the damage distribution (a commonly used, but wrong, assumption).
