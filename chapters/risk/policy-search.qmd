title: Policy Search & Optimization
---

## Learning Objectives {.unnumbered}

- Formulate policy design problems as optimization tasks.
- Explore multi-objective policy search (e.g., cost, emissions, equity).
- Evaluate strategies (carbon taxes, cap-and-trade) under uncertainty.

## Policy instruments and objectives

## Multi-objective optimization, Pareto front

## Heuristic vs. deterministic search methods

## Constraints (political feasibility, budget limits)
