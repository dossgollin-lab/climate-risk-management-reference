# Exposure and Vulnerability üìù

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you should be able to:

- Define exposure and vulnerability in the context of climate risk assessment
- Distinguish between different types of vulnerability (physical, social, economic)
- Understand methods for quantifying and mapping exposure
- Apply vulnerability assessment frameworks to real-world scenarios
- Integrate exposure and vulnerability data with hazard information for risk assessment

## Introduction

Climate risk emerges from the intersection of three components: hazard, exposure, and vulnerability.
While Part II focused on characterizing climate hazards, this chapter addresses the other two critical components that determine how hazards translate into actual risks and impacts.

**Exposure** refers to the people, livelihoods, species, ecosystems, environmental functions, services, resources, infrastructure, or economic, social, or cultural assets in places that could be adversely affected by climate hazards.

**Vulnerability** encompasses the conditions determined by physical, social, economic, and environmental factors that increase the susceptibility of an individual, community, assets, or systems to the impacts of hazards.

## Types of Exposure

### Physical Exposure

Physical exposure involves the presence of people, infrastructure, housing, production capacities and other tangible human assets located in hazard-prone areas.

### Economic Exposure

Economic exposure refers to the economic value of assets that could be affected by climate hazards.
This includes direct economic assets as well as economic activities that depend on climate-sensitive resources.

### Social Exposure

Social exposure encompasses the social systems, networks, and populations that could be affected by climate hazards.

## Vulnerability Assessment

### Physical Vulnerability

Physical vulnerability refers to the degree of damage that a specific asset or system would experience when exposed to a hazard of a given intensity.

### Social Vulnerability

Social vulnerability reflects the characteristics of people and communities that influence their capacity to prepare for, respond to, and recover from climate hazards.

### Economic Vulnerability

Economic vulnerability encompasses the economic factors that affect the ability to cope with and recover from climate impacts.

## Quantifying Exposure and Vulnerability

### Exposure Mapping

Methods for mapping and quantifying exposure include:
- Asset inventories
- Population databases
- Land use and land cover data
- Economic activity data

### Vulnerability Indices

Approaches to measuring vulnerability:
- Composite vulnerability indices
- Indicator-based assessments
- Survey-based methods
- Participatory vulnerability assessments

## Integrating with Hazard Information

The combination of hazard, exposure, and vulnerability information enables comprehensive risk assessment through:
- Risk mapping
- Loss estimation
- Scenario analysis
- Uncertainty quantification
