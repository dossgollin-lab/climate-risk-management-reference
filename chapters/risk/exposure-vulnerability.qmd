## Learning objectives

By the end of this chapter, you should be able to:

- Define exposure and vulnerability in the context of climate risk assessment
- Distinguish between different types of vulnerability (physical, social, economic)
- Understand methods for quantifying and mapping exposure
- Apply vulnerability assessment frameworks to real-world scenarios
- Integrate exposure and vulnerability data with hazard information for risk assessment

## Introduction

Given some _hazard_, how do we assess the _damages_ or _impacts_?

We can quantify this, for example as
$$
\textrm{Damage} = \textrm{Vulnerability} \times \textrm{Exposure} \times \textrm{Hazard}
$$

Let's understand these terms through some examples!

Climate risk emerges from the intersection of three components: hazard, exposure, and vulnerability.
While Part II focused on characterizing climate hazards, this chapter addresses the other two critical components that determine how hazards translate into actual risks and impacts.

**Exposure** refers to the people, livelihoods, species, ecosystems, environmental functions, services, resources, infrastructure, or economic, social, or cultural assets in places that could be adversely affected by climate hazards.

**Vulnerability** encompasses the conditions determined by physical, social, economic, and environmental factors that increase the susceptibility of an individual, community, assets, or systems to the impacts of hazards.

## Illustrative examples

\Pr(\textrm{failure}) = f(\textrm{hazard}, \theta)

### Seawall cost-benefit analysis

For a given storm, the total damages can be estimated by summing the damages for each property.
$$
\textrm{Total damages} = \sum_{i \in \, \textrm{exposure}} \textrm{Hazard}_i \times \textrm{Vulnerability}_i
$$

### Insurance portfolio risk

This is the most straightforward example of the exposure-vulnerability-hazard framework

- Hazard: a real or synthetic storm
- Exposure: all the assets that are insured
- Vulnerability: predicted losses as a function of the hazard

## Types of Exposure

### Trends in exposure

:::

### Physical Exposure

Physical exposure involves the presence of people, infrastructure, housing, production capacities and other tangible human assets located in hazard-prone areas.

### Economic Exposure

Economic exposure refers to the economic value of assets that could be affected by climate hazards.
This includes direct economic assets as well as economic activities that depend on climate-sensitive resources.

### Social Exposure

Social exposure encompasses the social systems, networks, and populations that could be affected by climate hazards.

## Vulnerability Assessment

### Changing vulnerability

Interventions such as floodproofing can shift the vulnerability curve

:::

### Physical Vulnerability

Physical vulnerability refers to the degree of damage that a specific asset or system would experience when exposed to a hazard of a given intensity.

### Social Vulnerability

Social vulnerability reflects the characteristics of people and communities that influence their capacity to prepare for, respond to, and recover from climate hazards.

### Economic Vulnerability

Economic vulnerability encompasses the economic factors that affect the ability to cope with and recover from climate impacts.

## Quantifying Exposure and Vulnerability

### Exposure Mapping

Methods for mapping and quantifying exposure include:
- Asset inventories
- Population databases
- Land use and land cover data
- Economic activity data

### Vulnerability Indices

Approaches to measuring vulnerability:
- Composite vulnerability indices
- Indicator-based assessments
- Survey-based methods
- Participatory vulnerability assessments

## Mathematical framework for expected damages

### Expectation

The expected value of a function $f(x)$ of a random variable $x$ is:
$$
\mathbb{E}[f(x)] = \int f(x) p(x) dx
$$
where $p(x)$ is the probability density function of $x$.

In other words, for each possible value of $x$, calculate $f(x)$.
We then take a weighted average, where the weights are the probability of each value of $x$.

### Key insight

You cannot get the expected value of a function by plugging the expected value of the random variable into the function.
$$
\mathbb{E}[f(x)] \neq f(\mathbb{E}[x])
$$

### Expected damages

If we want to calculate the **expected damages** then we can use this formula
$$
\mathbb{E}[f(x)] = \int f(x) p(x) dx
$$
by defining $x$ to be the hazard (e.g., flood depth) and $f(x)$ the damage function.

::: {.callout-important}
The key assumption we need is that we know the probability density function $p(x)$!
:::

### Monte Carlo approximation

In general, $\int f(x) p(x) dx$ is hard to compute analytically.
We can use Monte Carlo methods to approximate this integral.

:::{.callout-important}
Monte Carlo methods are a wide class of computational algorithms for approximating integrals.
:::

### Monte Carlo expectation

If we draw $N$ samples independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.) from a probability distribution $p(x)$, denoted as $\left\{x_i\right\}_{i=1}^N$ where $x_i \sim p(x)$, then
$$
\mathbb{E}[f(x)] \approx \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N f(x_i)
$$

::: {.callout-tip}
Drawing $N$ samples iid from $p(x)$ can be *inefficient*.
Most of the samples will be in regions where $f(x)$ is small, so we are wasting computational effort.
There are many clever ways around this.
:::

### For example: Trapezoidal EAD

Running regional flood models is computationally expensive.
Often, a model may have been run for a few different nominal **return levels.**
For example, we might have flood depths at each grid for the nominal 10, 25, 50, 100, 250, and 500 year floods.

## Integrating with Hazard Information

The combination of hazard, exposure, and vulnerability information enables comprehensive risk assessment through:
- Risk mapping
- Loss estimation
- Scenario analysis
- Uncertainty quantification

## Key points

1. Impacts (damage) depend on hazard, exposure, and vulnerability.
1. Exposure and vulnerability are changing rapidly.
1. To estimate risk, we need a model for how our system responds to a hazard.
1. If we know the probability density function of the hazard, we can use Monte Carlo methods to estimate expected impacts.

## Limitations of this framework

1. How to think about damages that are not direct damages (e.g., "indirect" damages)?
1. How to think about complex systems and risks (e.g., breadbasket failures) that are not easy summarized by a single metric?
