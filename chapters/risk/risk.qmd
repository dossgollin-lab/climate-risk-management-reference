## Learning Objectives

- Define and conceptualize risk within the climate context (hazard, exposure, vulnerability).
- Understand basic risk terminology (risk = probability Ã— consequence).
- Identify how different stakeholders perceive and prioritize climate risks.
:::

The most important concept is:
$$
\mathbb{E}\left[ f(x) \right] \neq f \left( \mathbb{E}[x] \right)
$$
where $x$ is some random variable and $f$ is some function.
In our context, this means that if we want to know the expected value of a risk-related variable, like damage, we should not just take the expected value of the hazard and then apply a damage function to that.
Extending the concept further, the damage caused by a hazard that scores in the 99th percentile of a chosen intensity measure may not be the 99th percentile of the damage distribution (a commonly used, but wrong, assumption).

## Damage

### Example: Depth-Damage Functions

### Example: Wind Fragility Functions

## Exposure

## Risk

### Risk Metrics

- Expected Annual Loss (EAL)
- Probable Maximum Loss (PML)
- Value at Risk (VaR)
- Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR)
