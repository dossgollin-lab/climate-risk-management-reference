title: Cascading Risks and Resilience
---

## Learning Objectives {.unnumbered}

- Recognize and analyze multi-hazard events (e.g., hurricane + storm surge + inland flooding).
- Understand how cascading failures in interconnected systems (power grids, supply chains) amplify risk.
- Integrate compound hazard assessments into broader risk management plans.

## Compound extremes and correlated hazards

## Infrastructure interdependencies

## Systemic risk and feedback loops

## Approaches to model or approximate cascading impacts
