## Learning Objectives

- Define and conceptualize risk within the climate context (hazard, exposure, vulnerability)
- Understand basic risk terminology (risk = probability Ã— consequence)
- Identify how different stakeholders perceive and prioritize climate risks
- Recognize and analyze multi-hazard events (e.g., hurricane + storm surge + inland flooding)
- Understand how cascading failures in interconnected systems (power grids, supply chains) amplify risk
- Apply systems thinking approaches to complex risk interactions

The most important concept is:
$$
\mathbb{E}\left[ f(x) \right] \neq f \left( \mathbb{E}[x] \right)
$$
where $x$ is some random variable and $f$ is some function.
In our context, this means that if we want to know the expected value of a risk-related variable, like damage, we should not just take the expected value of the hazard and then apply a damage function to that.
Extending the concept further, the damage caused by a hazard that scores in the 99th percentile of a chosen intensity measure may not be the 99th percentile of the damage distribution (a commonly used, but wrong, assumption).

## From Hazard to Impact

### Exposure

What and who is in harm's way? Exposure represents the people, property, ecosystems, and economic activities that could be affected by climate hazards.

### Vulnerability

The degree to which systems are susceptible to harm from climate hazards. Vulnerability depends on:
- Physical characteristics (building design, infrastructure quality)
- Social factors (income, education, social networks)
- Economic factors (insurance, savings, livelihood diversity)
- Institutional factors (governance, emergency response capacity)

### Damage Functions

#### Depth-Damage Functions

#### Wind Fragility Functions

## Risk Metrics

- Expected Annual Loss (EAL)
- Probable Maximum Loss (PML)
- Value at Risk (VaR)
- Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR)

## Cascading Risks and System Interactions

### Systems Thinking

A cool tool: https://ncase.me/loopy/

Climate risks rarely occur in isolation. Understanding and managing cascading risks requires systems thinking approaches that account for:

- **Interconnected infrastructure**: How failures cascade through power grids, transportation networks, communication systems
- **Supply chain vulnerabilities**: How disruptions propagate through economic networks
- **Social and institutional impacts**: How climate shocks affect governance, social cohesion, migration patterns

### Infrastructure Interdependencies

Modern infrastructure systems are highly interdependent:
- Power systems depend on water for cooling and transportation for fuel delivery
- Water systems depend on power for pumping and treatment
- Communication systems depend on power and transportation for maintenance
- Transportation depends on fuel supply chains and traffic management systems

### Multi-Hazard Events

Many climate disasters involve multiple hazards occurring simultaneously or in sequence:
- **Hurricanes**: High winds + storm surge + inland flooding + power outages
- **Droughts**: Water scarcity + agricultural losses + wildfire risk + energy shortages
- **Heat waves**: Direct health impacts + power system stress + agricultural losses + air quality degradation

### Systemic Risk and Feedback Loops

Climate risks can create feedback loops that amplify impacts:
- **Positive feedbacks**: Initial damage creates conditions for additional damage
- **Negative feedbacks**: System responses that reduce further damage
- **Threshold effects**: Non-linear responses when systems reach critical limits

### Approaches to Model or Approximate Cascading Impacts

- **Network analysis**: Modeling infrastructure as interconnected networks
- **Agent-based modeling**: Simulating individual actors and their interactions
- **System dynamics**: Modeling feedback loops and system behavior over time
- **Scenario analysis**: Exploring how cascading effects unfold under different conditions
