## Learning Objectives {.unnumbered}

- Distinguish between point estimation, interval estimation, and hypothesis testing.
- Conduct maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) for parameter inference in simple climate models.
- Compare frequentist inference to Bayesian inference at a conceptual level.
- Evaluate model assumptions (e.g., independence, stationarity) in climate data.

## Point estimators, bias, efficiency, and consistency

## Interval estimation: confidence intervals vs. prediction intervals

## Frequentist hypothesis testing (Z-tests, t-tests, etc.)

## Likelihood function, MLE, and model diagnostics
