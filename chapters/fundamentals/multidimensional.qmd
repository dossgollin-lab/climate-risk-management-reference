## Learning Objectives {.unnumbered}

## Covariance and correlation

## Structured variability

- e.g., model grid

## Dimension Reduction

- PCA (aka EOF)

## Copulas

## Deep Models

Many generative AI models are fundamentally samplingÂ from high-dimensional conditional distributions.
Handling the high dimensionality of these distributions is a key challenge.

- GAN
- cGAN
- Diffusion Models
