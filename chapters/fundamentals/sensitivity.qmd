title: Sensitivity Analysis
---

## Learning Objectives {.unnumbered}

- Understand the role of sensitivity analysis in diagnosing which inputs or parameters have the greatest impact on model outputs.
- Compare local (one-at-a-time) vs. global (variance-based, screening) sensitivity analysis techniques.
- Interpret how parameter uncertainties propagate through climate or risk models, guiding model refinement and resource allocation.
- Apply sensitivity metrics (e.g., Sobol indices) to prioritize data collection or reduce model complexity.
