## See First {.unnumbered}

This chapter builds on concepts from:
- [Probability and Statistics](/chapters/fundamentals/probability-stats.qmd)

## Learning Objectives {.unnumbered}

- Use Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques to estimate posterior distributions.
- Understand the role of utility theory in decision-making under uncertainty.

Monte Carlo is a powerful class of methods used to estimate the properties of a distribution by generating random samples from that distribution.
Specifically, Monte Carlo methods are used to estimate the expected value of a function of random variables.

## Overview

Monte Carlo methods are used to approximate integrals using sums.

## Motivation: Bayesian Inference

## Motivation: Resilience

## Motivation: Sensitivity Analysis
