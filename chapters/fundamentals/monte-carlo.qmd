## Learning Objectives

- Use Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques to estimate posterior distributions.
- Understand the role of utility theory in decision-making under uncertainty.
:::

Monte Carlo is a powerful class of methods used to estimate the properties of a distribution by generating random samples from that distribution.
Specifically, Monte Carlo methods are used to estimate the expected value of a function of random variables.

## Motivation: Bayesian Inference

## Motivation: Sensitivity Analysis

## Applications

### Markov Chain Monte Carlo

### MCMC with `Turing.jl`

## Further Reading {.unnumbered}

- Although about a decade old, @gelman_bda3:2014 is the definitive reference for Bayesian statistics
- @mcelreath_rethinking2:2020 takes a different pedagogical approach to @gelman_bda3:2014, covering similar concepts from a somewhat more applied perspective. Lectures are available [on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@rmcelreath).
- @gelman_workflow:2020 is a mini-textbook on Bayesian workflow
- @gelman_subjectiveobjective:2017 and @gelman_workflow:2020 cleanly outline how to think about interpreting probability -- which is often misunderstood.
