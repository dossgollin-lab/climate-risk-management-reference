## How to use this Part

- There are LOTS of fantastic stats, optimization, and Earth science resources, but they are often very narrowly tailored
- This section is NOT designed to be comprehensive. Provides an overview of fundamental concepts, then works through a couple of example methods and then points to resources for other methods.
- A course could work through these chapters in order, but it may make more sense to pick and choose, or to refer to them in the context of other chapters.
