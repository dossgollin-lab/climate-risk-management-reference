# Overview {.unnumbered}

## How to use this Part

- There are LOTS of fantastic stats resources, but they are often very narrowly tailored
- NOT designed to be comprehensive. Provides an overview of fundamental concepts, then works through a couple of example methods and then points to resources for other methods.
- Designed to be a reference and annotated bibliography
- A course could work through these chapters in order, but it may make more sense to pick and choose
