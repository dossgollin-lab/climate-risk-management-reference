## Learning Objectives {.unnumbered}

- Analyze temporal patterns (trends, seasonality) in climate variables like temperature or precipitation.
- Fit and validate basic time-series models (ARIMA, SARIMA) for forecasting.
- Recognize stationarity issues and handle non-stationary signals in climate data.

## Autocorrelation functions (ACF, PACF), stationarity tests

## AR, MA, ARIMA, SARIMA models

## Seasonal decomposition (trend, seasonal, residual)

## Wavelets
