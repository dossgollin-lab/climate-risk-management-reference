## Learning Objectives {.unnumbered}

- Grasp the key physical processes driving climate variability and change (radiative forcing, feedback loops).
- Understand the structure and outputs of Global Climate Models (GCMs).
- Recognize sources of uncertainty in climate projections (emission scenarios, model biases).

## Earth’s energy balance, greenhouse effect

## Atmosphere–ocean interactions, major climate feedback mechanisms

## Basics of GCMs and Earth System Models

## Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) and Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs)
