## Why climate science matters for risk assessment

Specific weather patterns create localized risks.
A hurricane generates storm surge that floods coastal communities.
Prolonged drought reduces agricultural yields and strains water supplies.
Intense precipitation overwhelms urban drainage systems.

These hazardous weather patterns are not random occurrences—they are embedded within planetary-scale atmospheric and oceanic circulation systems.
Understanding these connections helps us answer three fundamental questions for risk assessment: What drives the weather patterns that create hazards?
How do these patterns vary over time and space?
How might they change in the future?

Consider designing coastal protection for a city.
Historical storm surge records provide some information about hurricane impacts.
But hurricanes develop within larger atmospheric circulation patterns that can shift over time.
El Niño affects where storms track.
Atlantic Ocean temperatures influence storm intensity.
Climate change may alter all these relationships.

This chapter provides the climate science foundations for understanding these connections.
We focus on concepts that directly support probabilistic risk assessment rather than providing comprehensive climate science coverage.
The probabilistic framework for integrating this information is developed in [Probability and Inference](/chapters/fundamentals/probability-stats.qmd).

## Global energy budget and radiative forcing

Earth's climate system is fundamentally driven by energy balance between incoming solar radiation and outgoing terrestrial radiation.
The sun provides essentially all the energy that drives weather and climate.
This solar energy heats the surface, which then radiates energy back to space as infrared radiation.

Greenhouse gases in the atmosphere trap some of this outgoing longwave radiation, warming the surface.
This greenhouse effect is essential for making Earth habitable—without it, the planet would be about 33°C cooler.
However, human activities have increased atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases, creating an energy imbalance.

This radiative forcing—the difference between absorbed solar radiation and outgoing terrestrial radiation—is the fundamental driver of climate change.
The energy imbalance must be restored, primarily through warming that increases outgoing radiation.
Climate sensitivity, the equilibrium temperature response to doubled atmospheric CO₂, remains uncertain but is estimated at 2.5-4.0°C.
This uncertainty about the magnitude of warming from a given forcing propagates through all climate projections.

## Planetary circulation patterns

The energy imbalance between tropical and polar regions drives large-scale atmospheric and oceanic circulation patterns that distribute heat around the globe.
These planetary circulation systems create the framework within which all weather and climate variability occurs.

Atmospheric circulation includes the Hadley cells that transport heat from equator toward the poles, creating trade winds and the Intertropical Convergence Zone where much of the world's precipitation occurs.
The jet streams, driven by temperature gradients between warm tropics and cold poles, guide the paths of storm systems in midlatitudes.
The monsoons represent seasonal shifts in these circulation patterns as land masses heat and cool relative to adjacent oceans.

Oceanic circulation redistributes heat through thermohaline circulation driven by temperature and salinity differences.
The Gulf Stream carries warm water northward along the U.S. East Coast before crossing the Atlantic.
The Antarctic Circumpolar Current connects all ocean basins.
These currents influence regional climates and can change over time as the climate system evolves.

## Modes of climate variability

Within these overall circulation patterns, the climate system exhibits natural fluctuations that occur on interannual to multidecadal timescales.
These modes of variability represent the primary source of year-to-year climate predictability that risk managers must consider.

El Niño-Southern Oscillation exemplifies how ocean-atmosphere interactions create climate variability.
Changes in Pacific Ocean temperatures alter atmospheric circulation patterns, affecting precipitation and temperature around the globe.
El Niño events typically bring wetter conditions to the southern United States and drier conditions to Australia and Indonesia.
La Niña tends to have opposite effects.
The phase of ENSO doesn't determine the weather, but it shifts the probability distributions of temperature and precipitation across many regions.

The Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation influences hurricane activity and rainfall patterns around the Atlantic basin over 60-80 year periods.
The Pacific Decadal Oscillation affects climate variability along the Pacific rim.
The Arctic Oscillation influences winter weather patterns across the Northern Hemisphere.

These natural modes of variability interact with long-term climate trends.
A strong El Niño event superimposed on a warming climate can create record-breaking temperatures.
The timing of natural variability can temporarily mask or amplify underlying climate change signals.

## Regional climate and local weather patterns

The interplay between large-scale circulation patterns and modes of variability creates the specific weather patterns that lead to local hazards.
Understanding these connections requires drawing from several branches of climate science.

Atmospheric dynamics explains why storms form where they do and how circulation patterns like jet streams influence weather.
A meandering jet stream can create atmospheric river events that transport moisture from tropical regions to cause flooding in California.
Blocking patterns in the jet stream can create persistent high pressure systems that lead to heat domes over metropolitan areas.

Tropical meteorology focuses on hurricanes, monsoons, and other phenomena that dominate hazards in many regions.
Hurricane development requires specific combinations of sea surface temperatures, atmospheric instability, and circulation patterns.
Changes in these large-scale conditions affect where storms form, how they track, and how intense they become.

Hydrology examines how precipitation becomes streamflow and how watersheds respond to different rainfall patterns.
The same amount of rainfall can produce very different flood responses depending on antecedent soil moisture, snowpack conditions, and the spatial and temporal distribution of precipitation.

Ocean processes affect regional climate through heat transport and moisture sources.
Sea surface temperature patterns influence evaporation rates and atmospheric moisture content.
Changes in ocean circulation can alter regional temperature and precipitation patterns.

## The water cycle and climate extremes

The water cycle connects all these scales, from global energy balance to local precipitation extremes.
The same energy that drives planetary circulation also powers evaporation, atmospheric moisture transport, precipitation, and runoff.

![The water cycle plays a key role in our climate system. [{{< fa camera-retro >}}: USGS Water Cycle](https://labs.waterdata.usgs.gov/visualizations/water-cycle/index.html#/)](/_assets/img/USGS_WaterCycle_English_ONLINE_20230302.png)

Warming intensifies the hydrological cycle through the Clausius-Clapeyron relationship.
Warmer air can hold more moisture—about 7% more per degree of warming.
This creates potential for more intense precipitation extremes, even in regions where total precipitation doesn't increase much.

However, regional patterns depend on complex interactions between these thermodynamic effects and changes in atmospheric circulation.
While the water-holding capacity of air increases predictably with temperature, actual precipitation depends on atmospheric dynamics that lift air masses and cause condensation.
Changes in storm tracks, the frequency of weather patterns that produce precipitation, and seasonal timing can all modify how thermodynamic intensification manifests in different regions.

This multi-scale nature means that local weather hazards cannot be understood in isolation.
A drought that reduces crop yields may stem from circulation anomalies linked to sea surface temperatures on the other side of the globe.
The atmospheric river that causes flooding develops from moisture transport patterns spanning the entire Pacific Ocean.
Analyzing these connections requires specialized methods covered in [Correlation and Dimensionality](/chapters/fundamentals/correlation-dimensionality.qmd).

## Sources of uncertainty in climate projections

Now that we've built up the entire physical climate system—from global energy balance through planetary circulation to local weather patterns—we can understand how we use models to represent this system and why that process involves multiple sources of uncertainty.

Climate models are, in essence, complex hypotheses about how the climate system works.
A general circulation model represents our best understanding of atmospheric and oceanic physics, but it involves numerous simplifications and approximations.
The output from a model run is a realization from the model's joint probability distribution of all climate variables.
When we run ensembles of different models, we are sampling from our uncertainty about the structure of that distribution itself.

Historical observations provide direct measurements of past climate, but this record has important limitations for projection.
Observing stations are sparse in many regions, especially over oceans and remote areas.
Many regions have reliable records spanning only decades, which may not capture the full range of natural variability or rare extreme events.
Traditional statistical analysis assumes that statistical properties remain constant over time, but climate change violates this stationarity assumption.

Different climate models represent physical processes differently, leading to different projections even under identical greenhouse gas scenarios.
This model uncertainty reflects our incomplete understanding of cloud physics, ice sheet dynamics, vegetation feedbacks, and other processes.
Current generation climate models cannot resolve small-scale processes like individual thunderstorms or local topographic effects that strongly influence extremes.
Some models exhibit persistent biases, such as errors in tropical circulation patterns that affect regional weather [@sobel_biases:2023].

Future climate conditions depend on unknowable societal choices about greenhouse gas emissions, land use changes, and technological developments.
Different socioeconomic pathways lead to different radiative forcing scenarios.
Potential future interventions like solar radiation management could dramatically alter climate evolution.
This scenario uncertainty becomes the dominant source of uncertainty for long-term projections.

Internal variability represents the inherent, chaotic nature of the climate system.
Even with perfect knowledge of the climate system's initial state and governing equations, the climate would still exhibit unpredictable fluctuations due to its nonlinear dynamics.
This natural variability dominates uncertainty for near-term projections, where the signal of climate change may be smaller than the noise of natural fluctuations.

Some aspects of climate change involve deep uncertainty where we cannot assign meaningful probabilities to different outcomes.
Potential tipping points in ice sheets, circulation systems, or ecosystems could create abrupt changes that are difficult to predict or even identify in advance.
How climate impacts propagate through interconnected human and natural systems creates cascade effects that are inherently difficult to anticipate.

### The uncertainty cascade

Climate impact projections involve an uncertainty cascade where uncertainty compounds at each step.
Different emissions scenarios lead to different greenhouse gas concentrations.
Climate sensitivity uncertainty translates greenhouse gas concentrations to different global temperature responses.
Global changes manifest as different regional climate patterns through complex atmospheric and oceanic dynamics.
Regional climate changes then drive local impacts through sector-specific models for agriculture, water resources, coastal systems, and other domains.

Different sources of uncertainty dominate at different timescales and spatial scales.
For near-term projections (2030), internal variability often dominates uncertainty, meaning that natural climate fluctuations can mask or amplify climate change signals.
For long-term projections (2100), scenario uncertainty becomes most important, as different emissions pathways lead to dramatically different climate outcomes.
At regional scales and for extreme events, model uncertainty often dominates throughout the century because current models struggle to represent local processes and rare events.

## Statistical characteristics of climate hazards

Climate hazards exhibit statistical properties that challenge traditional risk assessment approaches.
Understanding why these challenges arise connects the physical climate science we've just described to the probabilistic methods needed for risk assessment.

### The decision-theoretic foundation

For any climate risk decision, we need to evaluate the expected reward or utility from different choices.
Mathematically, this requires computing:
$$
\mathbb{E}(R(a)) = \int_{\mathcal{S}} R(a, {\bf{s}}) p({\bf{s}}) d{\bf{s}}
$$
where $a$ is a decision, $R(a, {\bf{s}})$ is the reward function, and ${\bf{s}}$ represents the climate system state.

This formulation reveals a crucial insight that often gets overlooked in practice:
$$
\mathbb{E}(R(a)) \neq R(a, \mathbb{E}({\bf{s}}))
$$
We cannot simply use "average" climate conditions to assess risk.
The full probability distribution matters, especially the tails that represent extreme events.
As described in the previous chapter, our job is to use inference to learn about these probability distributions from limited and uncertain data.

### Properties that challenge traditional approaches

The physical processes we've described create several statistical characteristics that make standard statistical methods problematic.

Extreme events occur more frequently than normal distributions predict.
This "fat tail" behavior emerges from the nonlinear dynamics of atmospheric and oceanic systems.
Small changes in initial conditions or boundary forcing can lead to disproportionately large changes in outcomes.
This has profound implications for infrastructure design based on return periods and for insurance mechanisms that assume lighter-tailed distributions.

Climate change violates the stationarity assumption that underlies most traditional statistical analysis.
As we've seen, radiative forcing from greenhouse gases alters the fundamental energy balance that drives the entire climate system.
Statistical properties do not remain constant over time.
Mean values change as global temperatures rise.
Variability patterns shift as circulation patterns evolve.
The modes of climate variability we described—ENSO, the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation—may themselves change in a warming climate.

The multi-scale nature of climate processes creates challenges for statistical analysis.
Interannual variability like ENSO affects weather patterns globally over 2-7 year cycles.
Decadal patterns can dominate regional climate for decades.
This means that short observational records may miss important modes of variability that could affect risk assessment.
Each source of uncertainty—internal variability, model uncertainty, and scenario uncertainty—contributes to the overall variance in the posterior predictive distributions that we use for making decisions.

Extreme events often affect large regions simultaneously, challenging assumptions of spatial independence that underlie many risk models.
As we've seen, planetary-scale circulation patterns create spatial coherence in climate anomalies.
Heat waves can span entire continents when jet stream patterns create persistent blocking.
Droughts affect multiple countries within a river basin when large-scale circulation anomalies reduce precipitation over wide areas.
Understanding and modeling these spatial dependencies requires methods covered in [Correlation and Dimensionality](/chapters/fundamentals/correlation-dimensionality.qmd).

### Implications for climate information

These characteristics, rooted in the physics of the climate system, create requirements for climate information that supports decision-making.
Climate characterizations should be consistent with known physical processes rather than purely statistical constructs.
They should provide adequate spatial and temporal resolution for the impact assessment at hand.
Large ensemble sizes help quantify the uncertainty sources we've described rather than providing single-valued projections.
Multiple plausible scenarios acknowledge deep uncertainties about future emissions, policies, and system responses.

## Climate models: capabilities and limitations

General circulation models solve fundamental equations of fluid motion and thermodynamics on global grids to simulate Earth's climate system.
Earth system models additionally include biogeochemical cycles, vegetation dynamics, and ice sheet evolution.
These models excel at representing large-scale climate patterns and planetary-scale processes.

Climate models perform well for phenomena that are fundamentally driven by large-scale energy balance and circulation patterns.
They can simulate global temperature responses to greenhouse gas changes, seasonal cycles, and major circulation features like jet streams and trade winds.
They capture large-scale climate patterns like El Niño-Southern Oscillation and can project how these patterns might change under global warming.
For continental to global scale temperature and precipitation patterns over seasonal to decadal timescales, climate models provide valuable guidance.

However, climate models struggle with processes that occur at spatial scales smaller than their grid resolution or involve complex local interactions.
Most global climate models cannot resolve individual thunderstorms, squall lines, or tropical cyclones—exactly the phenomena that often create extreme weather hazards.
They must parameterize these sub-grid processes using statistical relationships that may not hold under changing climate conditions.
Local topographic effects, urban heat islands, and coastal processes require much higher resolution than is computationally feasible for century-long global simulations.

### The uncertainty cascade

Climate impact projections involve an uncertainty cascade from emissions to impacts.
Different socioeconomic pathways lead to different greenhouse gas concentrations.
Climate sensitivity—the global temperature response to doubled CO₂—remains uncertain, with current estimates ranging from 2.5-4.0°C.
Global temperature changes translate to regional climate patterns through complex atmospheric and oceanic dynamics.
Regional climate changes then drive local impacts through sector-specific models for floods, droughts, agriculture, and other consequences.

Uncertainty compounds at each step.
For near-term projections (2030), internal climate variability often dominates uncertainty, meaning that natural fluctuations can mask or amplify climate change signals.
For long-term projections (2100), scenario uncertainty becomes most important, as different emissions pathways lead to dramatically different climate outcomes.
At regional scales and for extreme events, model uncertainty often dominates throughout the century.

Climate models are evaluated against historical observations, process understanding, and paleoclimate data.
A model that reproduces observed climate trends and captures realistic physical mechanisms provides more confidence for future projections.
However, good historical performance doesn't guarantee accurate future projections, especially for unprecedented conditions or potential tipping point behaviors that lie outside historical experience.
