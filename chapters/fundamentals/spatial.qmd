## Learning Objectives {.unnumbered}

- Model and interpret spatial dependence in climate fields (e.g., rainfall across a region).
- Perform kriging and other geostatistical interpolations for mapping hazards.
- Understand the fundamentals of spatial autocorrelation and variogram analysis.

## Spatial autocorrelation, Moranâ€™s I, variograms

## Kriging (ordinary, universal), spatial prediction

## Handling large spatial datasets (e.g., reanalysis products)
