title: Bayesian Statistics and Utility Theory
---

Learning Objectives:

- Formulate Bayesian models for uncertain climate parameters.
- Incorporate priors and interpret posterior distributions in the context of climate data.
- Use Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques to estimate posterior distributions.
- Understand the role of utility theory in decision-making under uncertainty.

Key Topics

- Bayesâ€™ theorem, prior/posterior updating
- Conjugate priors and posterior analysis
- MCMC methods (Metropolis-Hastings, Gibbs sampling)
- Hierarchical models and hyperparameters
- Utility theory and decision-making under risk

## Recommended Resources

- Although about a decade old, @gelman_bda3:2014 is the definitive reference for Bayesian statistics
- @mcelreath_rethinking2:2020 takes a different pedagogical approach to @gelman_bda3:2014, covering similar concepts from a somewhat more applied perspective. Lectures are available on YouTube.
- @jaynes_probability:2003 is a definitive textbook on Bayesian philosophy in the context of physical systems and science.
- @gelman_workflow:2020 is a mini-textbook on Bayesian workflow
- @gelman_subjectiveobjective:2017 and @gelman_workflow:2020 cleanly outline how to think about interpreting probability -- which is often misunderstood.
