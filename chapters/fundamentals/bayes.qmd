title: Bayesian Statistics and Utility Theory
---

## Learning Objectives {.unnumbered}

- Formulate Bayesian models for uncertain climate parameters.
- Incorporate priors and interpret posterior distributions in the context of climate data.
- Use Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques to estimate posterior distributions.
- Understand the role of utility theory in decision-making under uncertainty.

## Bayesian Utility Theory

We will often be interested in making decisions despite not having perfect information.

### Types of uncertainty

- Aleatory uncertainty: inherent variability in the system (ie, randomness)
- Epistemic uncertainty: uncertainty in our knowledge of the system, often useful to divide into
    - Parametric uncertainty (what we will use here)
    - Model structure uncertainty (treated qualitatively)

### History

- First conceived as a way to try to explain human behavior
    - Turns out not to be a great model -- people do not always behave rationally

### Utility

- Some function that we want to maximize
- Alternatively can be thought of as a cost function that we want to minimize
- $U(a, \theta)$
    - $a$ is the action we take
    - $\theta$ is the state of the world

### Expected Utility

$$
\mathbb{E} \left[ U(a, \theta) \right] = \int_{\theta \in \Theta} U(a, \theta) p(\theta) d\theta
$$

or in the discrete case

$$
\mathbb{E} \left[ U(a, \theta) \right] = \sum_{\theta \in \Theta} U(a, \theta) p(\theta)
$$

## Further Reading

- Although about a decade old, @gelman_bda3:2014 is the definitive reference for Bayesian statistics
- @mcelreath_rethinking2:2020 takes a different pedagogical approach to @gelman_bda3:2014, covering similar concepts from a somewhat more applied perspective. Lectures are available on YouTube.
- @jaynes_probability:2003 is a definitive textbook on Bayesian philosophy in the context of physical systems and science.
- @gelman_workflow:2020 is a mini-textbook on Bayesian workflow
- @gelman_subjectiveobjective:2017 and @gelman_workflow:2020 cleanly outline how to think about interpreting probability -- which is often misunderstood.
