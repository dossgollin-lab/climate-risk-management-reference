## Learning Objectives {.unnumbered}

- Identify common machine learning techniques relevant to climate data (regression, classification, clustering).
- Evaluate model performance (cross-validation, error metrics) and address overfitting.
- Recognize opportunities and pitfalls of applying ML to complex climate problems.

## Supervised vs. unsupervised learning

## Common algorithms (random forests, neural networks, SVMs)

## Regularization (Lasso, Ridge) and hyperparameter tuning

## Interpretability and explainable ML (e.g., SHAP values)
