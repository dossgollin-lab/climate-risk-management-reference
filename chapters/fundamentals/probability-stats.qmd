## Key terms and ideas

- Probability as an axiomatic language for uncertainty
- Joint, conditional, and marginal distributions
- Bayes' rule
- Likelihood functions
- Maximum likelihood

## Further reading {.unnumbered}

For deeper study of probability and statistics:

- @blitzstein_probability:2019 provides excellent intuition with computational examples
- @downey_thinkbayes:2021 emphasizes Bayesian thinking with practical applications  
- @gelman_regression:2021 connects regression to broader statistical modeling

For climate applications specifically:

- [Monte Carlo Methods](/chapters/fundamentals/monte-carlo.qmd) develops computational approaches for complex problems
- [Model Comparison](/chapters/fundamentals/model-comparison.qmd) addresses choosing between different probability models
- [Correlation and Dimensionality](/chapters/fundamentals/correlation-dimensionality.qmd) handles spatial and temporal dependence
- [USACE Statistical Methods in Hydrology](www.hec.usace.army.mil/confluence/prospect/058-statistical-methods-in-hydrology-april-2025/statistical-methods-in-hydrology-april-2025-course-material) course

For hands-on application of these concepts:

- [Mosquito Example](/notebooks/mosquitos.qmd) demonstrates simulation-based statistical testing with concrete data analysis

The goal is not to become a statistician, but to use probabilistic thinking effectively for climate risk assessment.
