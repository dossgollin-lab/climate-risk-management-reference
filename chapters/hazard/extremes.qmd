title: Extreme Value Theory
---

## Learning Objectives {.unnumbered}

- Characterize the behavior of rare, high-impact climate events (e.g., floods, heatwaves).
- Select and fit appropriate extreme value distributions (GEV, POT).
- Calculate return periods and interpret their limitations under climate change.

## Extreme Value Theory
 (GEV distributions, block maxima, POT methods)

## Return level, return period, tail dependence

## Non-stationarity in extremes, trend detection in peak events
