## Climate and the Water Cycle

Climate refers to "the slowly varying aspects of the atmosphere–hydrosphere–land surface system." 
The water cycle plays a key role in our climate system, connecting atmospheric processes with terrestrial and oceanic systems.

## Statistical Characteristics of Climate Hazards

Climate hazards exhibit several key statistical properties that are crucial for risk assessment and management.
Understanding these characteristics helps explain why traditional statistical approaches often fail for climate extremes.

### Decision-Theoretic Foundation

For any climate risk decision, we need to evaluate:
$$
\mathbb{E}(R(a)) = \int_{\mathcal{S}} R(a, {\bf{s}}) p({\bf{s}}) d{\bf{s}}
$$

where $a$ is a decision, $R(a, {\bf{s}})$ is the reward/utility function, and ${\bf{s}}$ represents the state of the climate system.

**Crucial insight**: 
$$
\mathbb{E}(R(a)) \neq R(a, \mathbb{E}({\bf{s}}))
$$

This means we cannot simply use "average" climate conditions to assess risk.
The full probability distribution $p({\bf{s}})$ matters, especially the tails.

### Key Statistical Properties

Climate hazards are characterized by:

- **Fat tails**: Extreme events are more probable than normal distributions predict
- **Quasi-periodic oscillations**: Multi-year patterns like ENSO, AMO, PDO
- **Non-stationarity**: Statistical properties change over time due to climate change
- **Multi-scale variability**: Processes operate across temporal and spatial scales
- **Spatial coherence**: Extreme events often affect large regions simultaneously
- **Deep uncertainty**: Structural uncertainty about future climate evolution

### Examples of Climate Hazard Characteristics

#### Extreme Events: Recent Examples

**Floods in Paraguay, 2015**: Demonstrates the compound nature of climate hazards, where prolonged precipitation combined with river basin characteristics led to widespread inundation.

**Texas Cold Snap, 2021**: Illustrates how rare events outside the historical range of variability can have catastrophic impacts on unprepared infrastructure systems.

#### Fat Tails and Extreme Value Behavior

Many climate variables exhibit "fat tail" behavior, meaning extreme values occur more frequently than predicted by normal distributions.
This has profound implications for:
- Infrastructure design based on return periods
- Insurance and risk transfer mechanisms
- Emergency preparedness planning

#### Non-Stationarity and Climate Change

Traditional statistical analysis assumes "stationarity" - that statistical properties remain constant over time.
Climate change violates this assumption through:
- Changing mean values (e.g., rising temperatures)
- Changing variability (e.g., intensifying precipitation extremes)
- Shifting seasonal patterns
- Evolving spatial patterns of extremes

#### Multi-Scale Temporal Variability

Climate hazards vary across multiple time scales:
- **Interannual**: El Niño-Southern Oscillation (2-7 years)
- **Decadal**: Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (60-80 years)
- **Centennial**: Long-term climate trends and solar cycles
- **Millennial**: Ice age cycles and geological forcing

This multi-scale nature means that short observational records may not capture the full range of possible climate states.

### Implications for Climate Risk Assessment

#### Requirements for "Good" Climate Estimates

To support decision-making, climate hazard characterizations should be:
- **Physically realistic**: Consistent with known climate processes
- **High resolution**: Adequate spatial and temporal detail for impact assessment
- **Uncertainty-aware**: Large ensemble sizes to quantify uncertainty
- **Scenario-inclusive**: Multiple plausible futures for deep uncertainties

#### Why Extremes Matter

Climate risk assessment focuses on extremes because:
- Most climate impacts are driven by extreme events, not average conditions
- Infrastructure and ecosystems are often designed for historical extremes
- Climate change may disproportionately affect extreme events
- Extreme events drive most climate-related economic losses

### Discussion Questions for Climate Science

When studying climate science for risk assessment, consider these questions:

- What are the challenges of using climate models to predict future climate?
- What are the challenges of using climate models to predict future impacts?
- How can observations help us understand future climate when the climate system is changing?
- What is the difference between **climate risks** and **climate change risks**?
- How should we plan for climate change impacts that are highly uncertain?

These questions highlight the intersection between physical climate science and decision-making under uncertainty.

## What Drives Climate Hazard Uncertainty?

Understanding the sources of uncertainty in climate hazard assessment is crucial for effective risk management.

### Motivating Applications

#### Stormwater Infrastructure Design

Consider sizing a stormwater pipe:
1. Use rainfall-runoff model: $Q = CiA$ (rational method)
   - $i$ is rainfall intensity, $A$ is drainage area, $C$ is runoff coefficient
2. Select design rainfall based on return period $T$: $p(i > i^*) = 1/T$
3. Size culvert to handle design flow $Q^* = Ci^*A$
4. **Requires knowing** $p(i)$ - the probability distribution of rainfall intensity

#### Floodplain Mapping

For riverine flood risk assessment:
1. Analyze historical streamflow data at gauge locations
2. Estimate the 99th percentile (100-year return level) of annual maximum flows
3. Use hydraulic models to map flood extent and depths
4. **Requires understanding** the probability distribution of extreme flows

#### Reservoir Design and Operations

For water supply reliability:
1. Consider $N$ years of inflows, releases, and evaporation
2. Count failure events (reservoir emptying)
3. Repeat with different flow scenarios
4. **If sampling from** $p(\text{inflow})$, estimate system reliability using Monte Carlo methods

#### Index Insurance Pricing

For weather-based insurance products:
1. Define insurance index $I$ (e.g., total seasonal rainfall)
2. Set threshold $I^*$ for payouts of amount $X$
3. Payout probability: $p^* = p(I > I^*)$
4. Risk premium: $R = X \left( \mathbb{E}[p^*] + \lambda \mathbb{V}^{1/2}[p^*] \right)$
5. **Requires estimating** probability distributions and their uncertainty

### Case Study: Storm Surge Risk Assessment

#### Problem Statement
Design a storm surge barrier for Galveston Bay. What is the probability distribution of storm surge at your location?

This requires understanding multiple components:

#### Historical Data Analysis
- **Advantages**: Measures actual hazards at locations of interest
- **Limitations**: 
  - Sampling uncertainty from short records
  - Doesn't account for changing future conditions
  - Limited spatial coverage

#### Tropical Cyclone Characteristics
To generate synthetic storm records, we need to model:
- Storm tracks and intensities
- Wind and precipitation fields
- Storm surge physics using models (ADCIRC, GeoClaw, SFINCS)

#### Sea Level Rise Scenarios
Future storm surge risk depends on:
1. Greenhouse gas emissions scenarios
2. Climate system sensitivity to CO₂
3. Ice sheet response to warming
4. Local land subsidence rates

#### Model Limitations and Uncertainties

Recent research highlights persistent model biases:
> "Models are incorrectly simulating the equatorial Pacific response to greenhouse gas warming. This implies that projections of regional tropical cyclone activity may be incorrect as well" [@sobel_biases:2023]

### Sources of Uncertainty

#### Historical Data
- **Strengths**: Direct measurement of hazards
- **Weaknesses**: Sampling uncertainty, limited to past conditions

#### Model Simulations  
- **Strengths**: Can explore future scenarios, larger sample sizes
- **Weaknesses**: Model structure uncertainty, potential biases

#### Deep Uncertainty
Many aspects of future climate involve "deep uncertainty":
- Unknown probability distributions
- Uncertain model structure
- Ambiguous scenario definitions

### Key Concepts and Terminology

- **Return Period**: Average time between exceedances of a threshold
- **Return Level**: Magnitude of event associated with a given return period  
- **Monte Carlo**: Statistical sampling method for uncertainty quantification
- **Synthetic Record**: Model-generated data extending historical observations
- **Climate Sensitivity**: Global temperature response to CO₂ doubling
