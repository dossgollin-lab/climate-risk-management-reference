title: Data Assimilation
---

## Learning Objectives {.unnumbered}

- Integrate observational data into climate or weather models to refine forecasts (data assimilation).
- Understand ensemble-based and variational approaches (EnKF, 3D/4D-Var).
- Assess the impact of data assimilation on predictive skill for climate hazards (e.g., storms).

## Data assimilation concepts (analysis, forecast step)

## Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF), variational methods

## Updating model states with real-time observations
