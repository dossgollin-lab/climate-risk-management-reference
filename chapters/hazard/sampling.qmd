title: Optimal Sampling ðŸš§
---

## See First {.unnumbered}

This chapter builds on concepts from:
- [Monte Carlo Methods](/chapters/fundamentals/monte-carlo.qmd)
- [Optimization](/chapters/fundamentals/optimization.qmd)

## Learning Objectives {.unnumbered}

- Apply sampling techniques to generate synthetic event sets (e.g., hurricanes, floods).
- Use importance and stratified sampling to improve efficiency in hazard modeling.
- Evaluate how sampling choices affect estimates of extreme risk.

## Monte Carlo sampling and variance reduction

## Importance sampling, stratified sampling

## Synthetic event generation (hurricane tracks, extreme rainfall patterns)
    
## Balancing computational cost vs. accuracy in climate risk estimation
