# Surrogates and Emulators

## Learning Objectives {.unnumbered}

- Create faster, approximate models (surrogates) for complex climate simulations.
- Implement Gaussian Process regressors, polynomial chaos expansions, or other metamodeling techniques.
- Use surrogates for uncertainty quantification, sensitivity analysis, and optimization.

## Surrogate modeling (response surfaces, metamodels)

## Emulator-based sensitivity analysis

## Surrogate optimization strategies
