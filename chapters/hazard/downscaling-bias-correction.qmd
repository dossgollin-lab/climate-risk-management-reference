## Learning Objectives {.unnumbered}

*Learning objectives to be added as chapter develops.*

## Motivation

## Supervised Methods

Especially common in the context of weather forecasting, where we have pairs of (observed, forecasted) data.

### Example: Linear Regression

This is a very simple model

### Example: Model Output Statistics

### Example: Generative ML

This is a very sophisticated model.
Generative ML models are beyond the scope of this textbook (conditional GANs, diffusion models).
Goal: conditional on inputs, sample the distribution of outputs -- seems simple, right?

## Distribution-Based Methods

When we're working with climate models, there are no pairs of (observed, forecasted) data.
We might have a climate model that simulated the historical period, which means that we used observed boundary conditions (such as CO2 forcing, volcanoes, aerosols, etc.) but let the model generate different random variability.
This means that, while the model can generate simulations from a distribution of "days in late April in the 1990s, conditional on the particular model", there is no reason to expect that "April 15, 1995" in a model time series will be similar to "April 15, 1995" in an observed time series, except to the extent that the latter is a sample from the (approximated) distribution of the former.

This means that we cannot use supervised methods, because we don't have pairs of (observed, forecasted) data.
Instead, we need to use methods that compare the distributions of the two datasets.

### Example: Quantile-Quantile Mapping

### Example: CDF Matching
