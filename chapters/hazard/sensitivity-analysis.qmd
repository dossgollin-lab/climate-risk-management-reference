title: Global sensitivity analysis ðŸš§
---

## Learning objectives {.unnumbered}

After reading this chapter, you should be able to:

- Understand the role of sensitivity analysis in climate risk modeling
- Apply variance-based sensitivity methods (Sobol indices) to identify key parameters
- Use Morris screening methods for initial parameter importance ranking
- Interpret sensitivity analysis results for model simplification and uncertainty reduction

## Essential sensitivity analysis concepts

1. Global vs local sensitivity analysis approaches
1. Sobol indices and variance decomposition
1. Morris elementary effects for screening
1. Multi-model sensitivity analysis
1. Implementation strategies for complex model chains
