I am an assistant professor of civil and environmental engineering at Rice University.
My research focuses broadly on understanding and managing the risks of hydroclimate extremes, particularly urban flooding.
I teach CEVE 543 ("Statistical-Physical Methods for Hydroclimate Extremes and Catastrophes") and CEVE 421/521 ("Climate Risk Management").

See [dossgollin-lab.github.io](https://dossgollin-lab.github.io) for more information about my research.
